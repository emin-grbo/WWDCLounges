If you have a way to reliably exercise it into the state you're seeing to reproduce, that would be really helpful.\n\nWe also made a fix in Ventura with dispatch queues that we think could be your issue. Could you see if you could reproduce there as well?\n\nIf you can reproduce and are familiar, attaching using lldb and printing the state of your input queue and dispatch_get_global_queue(QOS_CLASS_DEFAULT, 0) would help the dispatch team narrow this down."
