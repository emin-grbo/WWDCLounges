Since StoreKit Testing in Xcode is local to your device, you won’t be able to test syncing purchases across different devices or simulators. If you’re using Xcode, you can simulate how your app behaves if a purchase is made on a different device in your unit tests using the `buyProduct(productIdentifier:)` method on `SKTestSession`: \u003chttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekittest/sktestsession/3579475-buyproductwithidentifier?changes=__3\u003e\n\nYou can still test how your app handles purchases made on the device with Xcode in the simulator. If your app can handle things like interrupted purchases and ask to buy in Xcode, you should be good to go for handling off device purchases :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThis is a great guide for how to set up StoreKit Testing in Xcode using any simulator, watchOS included: \u003chttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode\u003e\n\nYou just need to set up your scheme like the guide outlines, and then run the app in the simulator.\n\nWe have a session from WWDC 2020 on how to set up StoreKit Testing in Xcode in the simulator: \u003chttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10659/\u003e\nTomorrow, we’ll have a new session with some advanced instructions: \u003chttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10039\u003e",

To get the group ID check the `groupID` property. You can check when the transaction expires using the `expirationDate` property, keep in mind this date may be in the past.\n\nOn the `Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo` value you can check the `currentProductID` to get the same information as `productID` on the `Transaction` value. The renewal info value also allows you to check if the user changed their renewal preference such that the subscription will renew to a different subscription, or cancel at the end of the current period using the `autoRenewPreference` property.\n\nLet me know if you need any additional clarifications :slightly_smiling_face:",

They do describe the technical - and a quick review of the transcripts (OMG I LOVE THOSE!!!!) suggests that my one cool function is a great fit for an App Clip.\n\nIs there anyone here who can comment on how to best market these?  Print ads, posters, etc make sense - but what about stuff outside of the normal?  What are some of the most successful ways you’ve seen these promoted?",

You're correct - Product Page Optimization is a feature for apps in the iOS and iPadOS App Store, and the types of metadata that can be tested include: app icon, screenshot, and preview video. In addition to other metadata like keywords and description, and data filters for device and source type, what would be the most meaningful improvements to the feature for your app?"

Which store search keywords led to conversion improvements for specific treatments, and also being able to analyze further by region (not just by store language)? This would significantly improve optimizations for Custom Product Pages, as we could try out more alternatives at once.\n\nFirst time downloads vs. redownloads, and all the other filters available in other views of App Analytics would be very useful to be able to dive deeper into understanding the impact of different treatments. Right now it's basically a „ok, conversion for this has improved“, without being able to better understand what caused those improvements (and across which user segments).\n\nProduct Page Optimization is an amazing tool, however using it currently still feels like a 1.0 version. Adding the aforementioned metrics within ASC would give us a much better understanding of our user intents",

Another tip: Make sure to create these tiers within the same subscription group in App Store Connect to ensure customers have the ability to upgrade, downgrade or cross-grade between them. Note that if you choose to offer multiple tiers, each one will need to provide ongoing value and a continually innovated experience. For more information please see App Review guideline 3.1.2(a) for more information about creating a great subscription experience - subscriptions must be available across all of a user’s devices. Thanks, and enjoy the rest of WWDC!",

Another tip: Make sure to create these tiers within the same subscription group in App Store Connect to ensure customers have the ability to upgrade, downgrade or cross-grade between them. Note that if you choose to offer multiple tiers, each one will need to provide ongoing value and a continually innovated experience. For more information please see App Review guideline 3.1.2(a) for more information about creating a great subscription experience - subscriptions must be available across all of a user’s devices. Thanks, and enjoy the rest of WWDC!"
