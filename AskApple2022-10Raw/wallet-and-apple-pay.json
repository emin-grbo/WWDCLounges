However my experience was disappointing. First, it’s turned out that Mac has its own wallet that is different from the iPhone wallet, i.e. you have to manually re-add cards you already have in your iPhone wallet to the Mac wallet. Second, the Mac wallet isn’t enabled by default, and in order to enable it, the user has to reboot in safe mode and turn on some obscure deeply buried setting. All in all it looks like too much trouble for 98% of the users. I have also tried to use WebKit component embedded into my app window in order to use Apple Pay via web, but the Apple Pay extension is blocked in component mode for security reasons. The end result is that Apple Pay only reasonably works in stand-alone web browser and only in Safari. Am I doing something wrong? Are there plans to improve support of Apple Pay on the Mac, addressing the above mentioned problems?",
