    Hi all! SwiftUI on watchOS now appears to have a keyboard with QuickType. Can we provide values for QuickType to suggest specific strings? For example, let's say the user is searching in a long list of fruits. By passing the fruits data to QuickType, we could tell the system to suggest specific fruits whose name property matches the user-typed string, so that typing "a" does not suggest "and" but "Apple".  Right now we can pass suggestions to .searchable, but the suggestions are not shown while the user is typing. Instead, they appear as an overlay to List once the user finished typing and returns to the view. Also, .searchable does not bring up the keyboard right away, unlike TextFieldLink.

    Question about subscriptions on Apple Watch. I would like to have a single subscription to unlock content in my app across Apple devices.  According to this (https://developer.apple.com/support/universal-purchase/)|https://developer.apple.com/support/universal-purchase/) support doc: "To offer your app on iPhone and Apple Watch, create an iOS app with a watchOS counterpart in Xcode and upload the apps to App Store Connect from the same Xcode project. Watch-only apps cannot be part of a universal purchase. But during the WWDC22 talk about multiplatform apps: "Both my iOS and macOS app products use the same bundle identifier by default, which is awesome, because that means when I publish them to the App Store, they will be made available for Universal Purchase. So folks who buy my iOS app will also get my Mac app automatically." So, question: can we have a single subscription for content in an iOS app, and an independent watchOS app? :face_with_monocle:

    Multi-line text support in TextField is very exciting, but doesn’t seem to work in watchOS 9 beta 1. Will it be supported? And if so, will the keyboard editor support new lines? Currently all newlines are removed from any existing text (collapsing it to a single line) and there’s no way to type a return.

    Checking an analogy here. I've been working for years on an iMessage app extension which also has fragile debugging on simulator. Something that helps hugely is I built a unit test suite that can run on Mac so all my complex data handling logic gets heavily exercised in fast builds there, leaving the on-device testing to being UI-only. Is this a useful strategy for WatchOS?  Kinda a comment-as-question that might help @Simon &amp; others with the sync issues, and am asking for my own benefit as I restart a Watch project.

    Thanks for extending the ask questions workflow (left town right after WWDC 🫠).  Are there any conceptual limitations to building an app with only 1 input method (one finger) and 40mm-45mm screens? With Apple Watches getting more and more independent from iPhones, how far should we take apps (gaming, social media, etc.)?  Also, watchOS supports SceneKit but not Metal (at least not in the Xcode template), is there a reason for this conceptually or just technically?

    In watchos 7, the CoreBluetoooth framework worked great in the background, allowing for a constantly updated app interface on the watch. Especially if this application communicates via BLE with a peripheral that has more than 20 characteristics. There are problems with the BLE connection, and then the application has to connect to the periphery every time and read the initial values of the characteristics. This process could take up to 10 seconds for my app. Starting with watchos 8, the application on the watch, going into the background, stops communicating with the periphery. How will the CoreBluetooth framework change in the future to properly design my application on the watch?

It is correct to assume that the reason is different screen dimensions and Depth Effect requires some padding around the subject to work?

    I apologize if this is an overly basic question. When the watch series 6 came out I was very excited about the oxygen sensor. Outside of spot checks I was interested in righting and app to gather oxygen data overnight along with other parameters to provide an additional dataset for people with obstructive sleep apnea to share with their doctors. Is their a way to modify the polling rate on the oxygen sensor to pull more frequently (if so what’s the limit) and what’s the best way to approach this?  Please excuse my ignorance I’m new to Apple Watch and a novice at software development(this is more of a passion project for me not for a job/income and I’m intending to have this app be free and as a conversation starter for people and their physicians who are either diagnosed or think they may have sleep apnea and thus their doctor can conducted additional questioners and sleep studies to make an actual diagnoses or reassessment)

    Hi all! SwiftUI on watchOS now appears to have a keyboard with QuickType. Can we provide values for QuickType to suggest specific strings? For example, let's say the user is searching in a long list of fruits. By passing the fruits data to QuickType, we could tell the system to suggest specific fruits whose name property matches the user-typed string, so that typing "a" does not suggest "and" but "Apple".  Right now we can pass suggestions to .searchable, but the suggestions are not shown while the user is typing. Instead, they appear as an overlay to List once the user finished typing and returns to the view. Also, .searchable does not bring up the keyboard right away, unlike TextFieldLink.

    Question about subscriptions on Apple Watch. I would like to have a single subscription to unlock content in my app across Apple devices.  According to this (https://developer.apple.com/support/universal-purchase/)|https://developer.apple.com/support/universal-purchase/) support doc: "To offer your app on iPhone and Apple Watch, create an iOS app with a watchOS counterpart in Xcode and upload the apps to App Store Connect from the same Xcode project. Watch-only apps cannot be part of a universal purchase. But during the WWDC22 talk about multiplatform apps: "Both my iOS and macOS app products use the same bundle identifier by default, which is awesome, because that means when I publish them to the App Store, they will be made available for Universal Purchase. So folks who buy my iOS app will also get my Mac app automatically." So, question: can we have a single subscription for content in an iOS app, and an independent watchOS app? :face_with_monocle:

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
Nothing has changed with the ClockKit API in this release. Your app can request timeline reloads via <code>CLKComplicationServer.sharedInstance.reloadTimeline(for: ...)</code></p>
<p>|U03HHHJT28K|:
And a similar mechanism exists if you move to WidgetKit based complications</p>
<p>|U03HHHJT28K|:
<code>WidgetCenter.shared.reloadTimelines(ofKind: ...)</code></p>
<p>|U03HMEM4TM5|:
I see, thanks! So I assume the data flow is that it’s still up to the Watch app to react from <code>transferCurrentComplicationUserInfo</code> , store the data somehow, and trigger an update — in watchOS 9 or later using the WidgetKit API, in earlier watchOS versions using the CLK API, right?</p>
<p>|U03HHHJT28K|:
If you want to simplify, you can call both and the system will only reload your widgets if you’re running on watchOS 9 or later and have adopted WidgetKit based complications.</p>
<p>|U03HHHJT28K|:
After migrating to WidgetKit, your ClockKit based complications will no longer be run.</p>

<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Hi Enrico! Are you asking what is the best way to capture logs from your customers when filing Feedback with Apple, or what is the best way to capture logs for your own use?</p>
<p>|U03JLV0E8RJ|:
The second case is what i’m interested in most. The point is what method would you advise to receive logs from builds that have no debugger attached</p>
<p>|U03HL0NNTEG|:
Hi, Enrico. As far as I know, logging profiles are the only way to get logs for your application on production builds. But maybe somebody else knows of something obscure that I don't!</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
That’s the only way I know of also!</p>
<p>|U03HMESB695|:
In my own apps, I have a logging system that then pushes logs over WatchConnectivity back to the phone with a debugging view.</p>
<p>|U03JLV0E8RJ|:
Thanks Brian. Is it true that they unfortunately expire after a few days? Any more detail on that?</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
The profiles expire, but that doesn’t stop you from having your own logging. :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03HL0NNTEG|:
I believe the intention is to expire the profiles because often a user will forget they have it enabled and that can have power and performance implications.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Hi Sebastian. I’m not positive, but I don’t think this will work reliably, especially if your watch app is independent. Is there an API you want to use that would require you to go minOS 9.0?</p>
<p>|U03JELPN197|:
I mean if we update our app to watchOS 9 only in autumn, would it be possible for the Watch Series 3 users to download an old Version of our Watch App that supports watchOS 8, like it is on the App Store, where  users with older devices can still download the latest supported Version of an App?</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Yep, I understood the question. :slightly_smiling_face: My question back to you was: is there a reason you want to go watchOS 9 only?</p>
<p>|U03J201SFAP|:
And in a related question, is there anywhere besides Google search - where we developers can get meaningful statistics on WatchOS (or iOS/iPadOS) adoption rates?</p>
<p>|U03JELPN197|:
We would like to go for watchOS 9 only to get rid of the 32bit Binary for Watch Series 3. This increases the App size of the iOS app or am I wrong?</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
watchOS apps are already thinned for the platform they’re delivered to, so this isn’t something you need to worry about!</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
both the architectures and the assets are thinned for the device class and size. :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03JELPN197|:
But the Watch Binary is still a part of the iOS Binary right? If a user with a Series 3 downloads the iOS App is then in the Binary  a 32bit Version of the Watch App only or is  the 64bit Version also included?</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
The watchOS binary is not downloaded to the phone if the paired watch is running watchOS 6.0 or later. It does not make your iOS app any bigger.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HL0NNTEG|:
Can you please clarify what you mean by "List with sections"?</p>
<p>|U03HHJK2FJ6|:
A list with sections sounds interesting! You can also use multiple Pickers. Please do file a feedback about DatePicker (or any other enhancements you may think of)</p>
<p>|U03HL0NNTEG|:
Yep, a date picker is definitely something that we've been missing for a while.</p>
<p>|U03J21EKNSE|:
Thank you Brian D and Matthew K. I had almost built the app with 3 separate pickers in UIKit, but had problems keeping track of the different number of day requirements (we don’t want anyone saying “June 31”. I have a watchOS lab tomorrow, but wanted to trim down my question (15 min is a short time for the messy situation I</p>
<p>|U03J21EKNSE|:
… I am in (but I will definitely take it!)</p>
<p>|U03J21EKNSE|:
Moving from UIKit to SwiftUI gave me different problems… life is interesting!</p>
<p>|U03J21EKNSE|:
By “List with Sections” I meant a list where I could send user to separate detail views for the entries, or list elements (apologies for the incorrect term) that could hold TextFields. But that is not great in watchOS. BTW: what happened to number pads in watchOS 8?</p>
<p>|U03HHJK2FJ6|:
There's a couple examples of date pickers in some of our watchOS apps. For example, Reminders has a version of a date picker when editing. They reset the day picker's value when the month picker changes, to prevent a user from picking an invalid date.</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
Also, please file a feedback about number pads.</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
And explain the use case, what you need out of the number pad.</p>
<p>|U03J21EKNSE|:
Thanks; will check Reminders, and type feedback. The number pad is to enter year and a second field for a Date calculation; will elaborate in the feedback report.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Hi Matthew! Updating to recommended settings attempted to convert your existing watch project to a single-target app, and missed a setting. Most likely you just need to add <code>WKApplication</code> to <code>1</code> in your Watch App target’s Info.plist.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
if that doesn’t do the trick, we can go into a bit more detail about your project to try to figure it out. :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03J20PPN3U|:
Cool. I went to my Watch App targets Info.plist and added <code>WKApplication</code> value <code>1</code>. I then got an error saying I have both <code>WKApplication</code> and <code>WKWatchKitApp</code> and should only have one of those keys. Should I remove <code>WKWatchKitApp</code> from the Info.plist?</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
let’s back up a bit, in that case. Is your app storyboard-based or SwiftUI (App) Lifecycle?</p>
<p>|U03J20PPN3U|:
SwiftUI</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
if you’re using <code>App</code>, you need to annotate your App type with <code>@main</code>, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>@main 
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            NavigationStack {
                ContentView()
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>|U03J20PPN3U|:
In my <code>WatchApp.swift</code>  file found in my WatchKit Extension I do have my  App type annotated with <code>@main</code> , is that what you are referring to?</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
yep. we might need to look at your project together, then. can you sign up for one of the watchOS labs and note in your question that you were referred from the digital lounge?</p>
<p>|U03J20PPN3U|:

Currently I have to be lucky to get it to work.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJK2FJ6|:
Here's a couple tips!</p>
<p>Like any wireless connection, the connection between Apple Watch and iPhone is dependent on network conditions.</p>
<p>When debugging, Apple Watch automatically prefers a WiFi connection to the phone to improve the speed. However, that has some requirements:
• The iPhone and Watch are on the same WiFi network.
• Consider that some Apple Watches only work on 2.4Ghz networks.
• Some networks disable peer to peer connections, which will prevent WiFi from working.
• Network congestion can play a part in causing issues.
• Make sure the Apple Watch is sufficiently charged (we recommend keeping the watch on the charging puck while debugging)
If WiFi is otherwise unavailable, we use Bluetooth for the connection which will be slower.</p>
<p>|U03JELPN197|:
Thank you very much. Will check again whether I can adjust the network somehow better when debugging with a real device.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
The second is enqueued. If you add a third… we’ll take a peek at the requests and decide which one to keep</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
This is because a reload might be in-progress just as you get new data, and so your app requests another reload. It’d be mean for us to ignore that second one, since you had no control over when the first reload actually happens</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
But if you give us a third reload request…, well that’s greedy and we will throw one away :)</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
There was a cool WidgetKit talk in WWDC 2021 about reloads and budgets</p>
<p>|U03HMEM4TM5|:
thanks! I mean, if the user makes 3 changes in the app, that does mean that we honestly need to update 3 times</p>
<p>|U03HMEM4TM5|:
I suppose you’d recommend throttling?</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
There’s nothing wrong with requesting a third time, because you don’t control when the reloads will happen. We’ll be sure to keep one of the reload requests queued up, and when budgets allow, we’ll reload your widget with whatever is the current latest content</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
We’ll do throttling too. Depends on several factors such as how frequently your widget is viewed, and there is a daily budget. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/keeping-a-widget-up-to-date">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/keeping-a-widget-up-to-date</a> has more</p>

Right, Tennis is not a workout for which you can collect a route, but if you request location permissions, you might be able to capture the user’s location at the time the workout was started and/or ended, which would be sufficient for a pin.</p>

WidgetKit supports all watch faces that previously used the "graphic" complication templates. Luckily, we also updated a bunch of watch faces to use that "graphic" style in watchOS 9!</p>
<p>|U03HHJK2FJ6|:
Once you start using WidgetKit for complications, the system will always prefer using those complications even if your app provides complications via ClockKit.</p>

There's some great sessions this year that goes over the migration path between ClockKit and WidgetKit.</p>

<p>|U03HELSFX3P|:
Yeah, I think multiple pickers would be the way to go, but don’t be afraid to experiment and find something that fits your app’s needs.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Hi Mayra! Yes, for now multiple pickers is probably the best way to implement a date picker manually. We will absolutely take your Feedback about wanting a <code>DatePicker</code> for watchOS, tho!</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
In the Feedback, tell us the combinations of dates/use cases you’re most interested in!</p>
<p>|U03J21EKNSE|:
Thank you! The multiple picker implementation is almost 95% done in WatchKit/UIKit, but I am moving it to SwiftUI to see if it’s “easier”. The main problem I am encountering is matching the checks needed to make sure days offered are correct with respect to year (leap or not) and 30/31 days for the rest of the months. I hope the new capabilities in watchOS9 and SwiftUI will help me finish!</p>
<p>|U03J21EKNSE|:
Homework accepted: will file tonight!</p>
<p>|U03JEDKRZJ6|:
I'd have thought the watch screen size is just about big enough for the new date picker option on swiftui, would be great to see it there</p>
<p>|U03J21EKNSE|:
Same here, but I’ve been waiting for something like it for two years… I’m sure it will happen right after I hit my last bug. And the official implementation will be better (of course)!</p>

My question is regarding Portrait watch face. I've been playing around with different images and what pique my curiosity was the fact that the same image might be used with depth effect on the new iOS Lock Screen while not supporting Portrait on the watch. It is correct to assume that the reason is different screen dimensions and Depth Effect requires some padding around the subject to work?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHHK57K5|:
Starting with watchOS 9, the Portraits face <em>does</em> support photos from your entire photos library (not only those taken in Portrait mode), just like the new lock screen. However, I think you're right in your analysis of screen size/shape, padding around the subject, etc. In order for the depth effect to work, there needs to be the right amount of overlap between the foreground subject and the time and the variables you mentioned that are different between the phone and watch would affect that amount.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
hi Jan! When the original Apple Watch was released, it was pretty revolutionary—but not very powerful (at least compared to the current models!). Thus in watchOS 1, the code for third-party WatchKit apps ran on iPhone, as an extension to the companion iOS app, and drove the UI on the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
The code <em>had</em> to be in two targets, because they went to different devices! And the WatchKit Extension target truly was an extension.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
This changed in watchOS 2, when the contents of both targets moved to Apple Watch.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
We are so excited to simplify the developer experience this year by merging the targets in Xcode, and by offering a new Watch App target that makes your options clearer up front.</p>

Debugging tip that may help @Simon, based on a few years now of working on a very complex iMessage app extension. Not quite as hard as WatchKit comms but Messages simulator debugging is pretty fragile too.</p>
<p>Thanks to a friend pushing me, I made the bulk of my complex logic able to compile cleanly on Mac and run unit tests there. (I have a document model that rivals Keynote in complexity, so encode/decode &amp; DOM manipulation is significant - 500 tests now).</p>
<p>That saves me massive time &amp; so can focus on <em>just</em> UI testing on the devices.</p>

<p>|U03HL004760|:
This can be done!
1. Add the iOS App Target
2. On the General settings for the iOS App Target, add the Watch App to the Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content list.
3. On the Build Settings, search for Bundle Identifier. Set the WatchKit Companion App Bundle Identifier to the Bundle Identifier of the Watch App.
4. Delete the iOS Stub target that was originally created when you created the Watch Only app.
5. Delete the iOS Stub from the Watch App scheme Build.</p>

<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
Yes, audio and navigation sessions also give you unmetered refreshes on watchOS! The timeline reload budget is roughly the same, but the Background App Refresh and runtime budgets are different; the widget extension is metered separately from your main app with WidgetKit</p>
<p>|U03JCQQ5CRJ|:

Only on the same device, there's no sharing between them.</p>

I’d suggest using the WatchConnectivity’s Application Context to communicate the information from iOS to Watch.

Hi Steven! I’m curious about why you want to avoid using cloud storage. If you used Core Data with CloudKit, then you’d get the data synchronization there.
This session might be helpful in looking at various strategies: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10003/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10003/</a>. Sometimes you might need to combine strategies to get the right experience.</p>
<p>|U03JG3QTSGL|:
Hi Anne, thanks for replying.  I am hoping as far as possible to allow the user complete control over their data (for privacy), So I was working on the assumption that the most private is on device, then iCloud. So in my mind I had the idea of allowing the user to select either to store data only on their device, or on iCloud. I assumed that with Watch connectivity the data would stay on the Phone, with the Watch having access to it. Thanks for the link to the video, I will going and watch it now. Thanks again.</p>
<p>|U03HL004760|:
So many of us are a lot more conscious now about how our data is being stored and shared, so it’s great that you’re considering this so strongly. :heart: It’s a balancing act. You want to protect everyone’s privacy and also ensure that they don’t lose data should something happen to their phone. Options are always good. I hope the video helps, and definitely read about privacy and security with iCloud. Once you know all the options, you can make the best choice to provide the level of privacy you want to deliver.</p>
<p>|U03JG3QTSGL|:
That video was great, just at the right level too. I see what you mean about maybe needing to think about combining strategies, and also the trade off between privacy and usability.</p>

<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Hi Jan. Yes, your watch app is considered part of your iOS app for App Store purposes, but it can still be independent.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Check the Runs Independently of iOS Companion App box in the Xcode project editor to make your watchOS app independent.</p>

Thank you &lt;@U03H96N55U5&gt; :pray:  so it does not matter (for universal subscription) if the watch app targets have their own bundle identifiers that differ from the iOS app?</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
If I recall correctly, the watchOS app should have the same root identifier as the iOS app. E.g., com.fancyapps.mymealtracker (iOS) and com.fancyapps.mymealtracker.watchkitapp (watchOS)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HL004760|:
This is certainly a reasonable analogy (and not even where something is fragile). The more you make your model testable and test that directly, the more efficient you can make your testing. You can also potentially keep your quality high (assuming your tests are well-designed, of course). :slightly_smiling_face:
UI tests will take longer to develop and run. Having good model tests allows you to focus your UI tests on testing the actual UI.</p>
<p>|U03JELM0ZNV|:
I have a complex document model for encoding games that does things like particle emitters in 1/20th the Apple formats. Lots of bit fields. You bet my tests are exhaustive 500 of them, about 25% of code is test code when I'm working on the core model!

From what you’re describing, you don’t need data transfer at all. Your <em>app</em> can store the fact that you ate the donut (your intent could be invoked by something like, “hey Siri, tell MyDietTracker that I ate a donut,” and MyDietTracker records that you ate the donut. The complication can be updated based on that data when the app is running, or using background app refresh.</p>

<p>|U03HL0NNTEG|:
Hi, Simon.</p>
<p>I have verified that if you use <code>CMFallDetectionManager</code>  to observe fall events this does not affect the default system behavior. Your app will be briefly woken up in response to fall events so that it can do a small amount of work, like sending a notification, or something similar.</p>
<p>|U03HL0NNTEG|:
You can also request recent fall event samples from HealthKit.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Keep in mind that you will need an entitlement to use <code>CMFallDetectionManager</code>. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmfalldetectionmanager">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmfalldetectionmanager</a></p>
<p>|U03HL0NNTEG|:
Here's the documentation for the HealthKit fall detection samples: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifier/1615592-numberoftimesfallen">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifier/1615592-numberoftimesfallen</a></p>

<p>|U03HL004760|:
The best way to test your SwiftUI app on watchOS is to make your model layer testable and write thorough tests for that with XCTest. This will allow you to concentrate you UI testing on Watch to the UI itself.
You can build a test suite for your model layer and run it to catch any regressions. You can find documentation for XCTest here: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest</a>, and there are a lot of great WWDC session videos about designing and writing tests.</p>

Hi Sergey! Starting in watchOS 9.0, bluetooth peripherals that your app connects to will stay connected even when the application is suspended.

I recommend watching the "Get Timely Alerts from Bluetooth Devices on watchOS" video, new this year to learn about all the details of the new capabilities!</p>

<p>|U03HL0NNTEG|:
Hi, Emre. There are a couple of parts to this question, but I think the most important part is whether it's better to do a large amount of work spread out over a longer period of time or to do it all at once.</p>
<p>There are a couple of great WWDC talks that address this. One that really helped me to get into the right mindset about this was this one: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/707/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/707/</a></p>
<p>Doing a task on a mobile device requires spinning up whatever hardware is needed to do the task. That can be a CPU, or wireless radios. All of those things require power to run, and turning them on and off frequently is a very quick way to burn down the user's battery. So the best thing to do is to do as much work as you can in as short a time as possible and then let the device go back to sleep.</p>
<p>|U03HL0NNTEG|:

Hi Frederic! What do you mean that the application is already started, and you just need to wake it up? Can you elaborate on your use case?</p>
<p>|U03JSSE35GQ|:
Yes. The application is a workout application with a workout in progress. I just would like the iPhone application to send it a message in order to update some data that are only available on the iPhone so that when the user raise his/her hand, he/she can see the updated data immediately.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
OK, so it’s not really about “waking” the watch or the app (it’s already running); you’re looking for data to be transferred immediately.</p>

Yes, but when the Watch application is in the inactive state (watch screen is off).</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
OK then no, there is no way for you to wake the screen programmatically.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
You can still send data over, and the user will see it when they raise their wrist (if that’s how you’ve designed the UI, of course).</p>

<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Hi Hidde! So nice to meet you in person on Monday. :blush: CoreData sync via iCloud is pretty much automatic, but keep in mind that when syncing happens is based on system and network conditions. <em>Usually</em> data is available pretty quickly, but sometimes it can take longer.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
It’s helpful to design your experience with the expectation that data might not arrive immediately.</p>
<p>|U03HMDG985D|:
I can relate to the question. A lot of my support questions were related to ‘stale’ data (which would correct itself in just a few seconds upon launch of the Watch app).</p>
<p>One thing that helped is communicating proper expectations to my users. Overall, CoreData+CloudKit was super convenient for both myself and my users. I just had to temper their expectations: Yes, your data is safe. You just need to be patient if you’re doing a fresh launch of the app.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:

I will probably relate to this soon, since I want to expand my app to watchOS. &lt;@U03HMDG985D&gt; could this be solved with a loading indicator (e.g. progress view) while the data is being loaded? Can we even detect that data after a fresh launch is still being loaded?</p>
<p>|U03HMDG985D|:
If you’re doing the CloudKit yourself, I think you could. If you’re using <code>NSPersistentCloudKitContainer</code>, there is no way to know when the syncing begins (though you might be able to tell when it ends via the associated events notifications).</p>
<p>In my case, I’m using the persistent cloud kit container, so I can’t provide that UI to my users. (I tried; it wasn’t consistent.) Which is where informing/instructing my user was more valuable.</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
Thanks, that's very insightful. I am using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer. So I guess I will go with a simple disclaimer. Can we even detect that the user already has some data in CloudKit, so that the disclaimer will not be shown to users who are totally new to the app?</p>
<p>|U03HMDG985D|:
Wouldn’t that map directly to the presence of data in your persistent container?</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
I suppose. But if I just set up a disclaimer to show once container receives data, the disclaimer will also appear if a new user creates some data</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
what is the data that y’all are waiting for? fwiw I was thinking along the lines of relying on data that’s already on the watch (because it’s generated by the watch, or stored there) whenever possible, and augmenting with data from other sources when it becomes available. this isn’t <em>always</em> possible, of course; if you have a reminders/task or grocery list app across platforms, the user is going to expect those to sync, and in that case spinners and other syncing UI might be approrpriate.</p>
<p>|U03HMDG985D|:
And even if your app has no local data on first launch and you show your ‘new user’ UI, once your local Core Data store syncs up, you could update your UI. So the disclaimer would go away. And maybe the disclaimer can include wording that, if they have used the app on another device with the same Apple ID, that they can expect to see data soon.</p>

<p>|U03HELSFX3P|:
You can! The “<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10052/|What’s New in SwiftUI">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10052/|What’s New in SwiftUI</a>” video shows how you can use the <code>accessibilityQuickAction</code> API to configure what will happen when the user makes an assistive touch gesture.</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
Also, here's the documentation link for this. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/accessibilityquickaction(style:content:)">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/accessibilityquickaction(style:content:)</a>
It's a new API available for watchOS only in watchOS9. The user does need to have accessibility quick actions enabled via Settings -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; Quick Actions -&gt; On. It's also limited to detecting the double pinch gesture only.</p>
<p>|U03JELM0ZNV|:
I'd also found last years's video <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10223/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10223/</a> but no matching docs, was looking at the code.</p>

AssistiveTouch works with the same accessibility infrastructure as VoiceOver. Following best practices for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view-accessibility|Accessibility in SwiftUI">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view-accessibility|Accessibility in SwiftUI</a> will make your app work well with AssistiveTouch.</p>

<p>|U03HL004760|:
I don’t have a great recommendation for how to check this in advance. But in general, are you having issues with this when submitting your app?
I know we all want to be good Watch app citizens and some devices are quite limited on storage. If you’re using a lot of storage, people might get frustrated and uninstall your app. Have you considered  ways to reduce the size of your app and still deliver a great experience? I know this is a constant challenge.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Hi Dan! You should only make a watch-only app if you don’t have an iOS app with the same or related functionality already. Functionally a watch app that can run independently of its iOS companion app operates as if it is watch only if its companion is not installed, as in my Insight Timer use case from an earlier thread (I only install Insight Timer on the watch, and never install the companion iOS app).</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
that’s a lot of words, I realize. :stuck_out_tongue:</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
If you have an iOS app, and your watchOS app offers the same or related functionality, they should be considered “the same app” and submitted together.</p>
<p>|U03JELM0ZNV|:
In iMessage apps, another restriction is lack of access to IAP for an extension-only app. So you're strongly encouraged there to have a "real" parent app.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
hi Andrew, that’s unrelated</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Watch apps are not extensions of iOS apps.</p>
<p>|U03JELM0ZNV|:
are you saying Watch-only apps have store IAP access?</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
and Watch apps do support IAP!</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
yes!</p>
<p>|U03JELM0ZNV|:
yay!</p>
<p>|U03JELM0ZNV|:
Thanks for clarifying the architecture - I started with WatchOS when they were much more tightly coupled.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
yeah! I have a little bit on the history in a previous thread; let me find it.</p>
<p>|U03J1UGE04B|:
Thanks! I think watch-only would be rare.</p>

<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Watch-only is less common, certainly, but there are still several hundred watch-only apps in the App Store. :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03J1UGE04B|:
Ah yes - I do have one called Geneva Moon that shows you moon phases and can locate the moon with the compass! Very fun</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Yeah! Watch-only apps are also a <em>great</em> way to learn SwiftUI, especially for students. You can create small and useful applications without having to worry about also building an iOS app.</p>
<p>|U03J1UGE04B|:
How does the connection to Xcode work? I don’t think I’ve tried since Xcode 12 - but it seemed like getting a real device to connect was difficult. It still has to go through a paired iPhone, right?</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
yes, plug in the iPhone via lightning cable (don’t try to do WiFi debugging on the phone and then also debug the watch app!)</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
you don’t want to do more hops than you need to. :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

I’m looking forward to Xcode 14 connecting to my iPhone better - I had to do my share of rebooting to get my iPhone connected with Xcode 13. And the AppleTV is easier to deploy to through TestFlight than directly across my house :dizzy_face:</p>
<p>|U03J1UGE04B|:
Thanks so much for those tips… now that I’m thinking about it - I was using a S2 watch so that wasn’t probably very quick either. I’ll have to try with Xcode 14 and my S7! :rocket:</p>
<p>|U03HHJK2FJ6|:
Yes! That should help. Series 7 supports 5Ghz WiFi as well. :crossed_fingers: you should have a better time.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
omg yes please use a Series 6 or later if you have one!</p>
<p>|U03J1UGE04B|:
It got to be a challenge to see how long my S2 could last - it was something like 5 years!</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
I still have a Series 2 that I use to test various scenarios, but I definitely don’t debug on it. :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
&lt;@U03JFUBCW85&gt; Could you elaborate on what issue you see? What are the error messages / symptoms when the problem occurs?</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
or... rather, what were they when you were hitting the issue in watchOS 6.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
Spoiler alert: It’s not the binary size that’s the problem here. :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03JFUBCW85|:
So this was happening during the watchOS 6 beta period. Haven’t tested out the limit since.
As I remember it, Watchdog killed the app, but maybe I’m misremembering and it was happening in App Store Connect? Like was just mentioned here: <a href="https://wwdc22.slack.com/archives/C03GSLANZJT/p1654795299375599">https://wwdc22.slack.com/archives/C03GSLANZJT/p1654795299375599</a>
Not sure anymore I’m afraid.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
So Sebastian is asking about the size limit when submitting to the App Store (because that’s where the 75MB limit applies).</p>
<p>|U03JFUBCW85|:
I see, that’s probably what I was hitting as well then. I’m a bit hazy on the details, as it’s been so long.</p>
<p>|U03H96N55U5|:
give it another whirl! :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03JFUBCW85|:
I will, for sure. Thanks for the info. These lounges are really great!</p>

Hi, Emre.</p>
<p>Sending a message via WatchConnectivity from your Watch App will wake the iOS app. However, you can't due this forever, as the messaging will be limited eventually.</p>
<p>Can you tell us a bit more about what you're trying to do here?</p>
