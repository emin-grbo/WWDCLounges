    Hello all, hope everyone is doing well, i would like anyone's input on streaming audio through MQTT messages. I have created a working class that uses AudioQueue to grab packets of a certain size and listen to these bytes after applying an algorithm to it. I've done this for talking and listening using AudioQueue only. However, sometimes there could be some instability when listening and talking. Does anyone have any improvements or things i can look out for when handling live streamed audio data with AudioQueue? Or is this the right service for streaming audio? Just for context, I've tried AVAudioEngine but a few issues arose when doing so. Thanks!

    Hi! I have a fairly technical question that might have been a better fit for a lab, but I missed the deadline on Monday to apply for it. :pensive:  I am using a custom Core Image compositing pipeline (via the AVVideoCompositing protocol) that is using CIFilters for adjusting a foreground and background video and combine them via alpha blending/masking.  The custom compositor has some parameters stored in an instance conforming to the AVVideoCompositionInstructionProtocol.  The goal is for the user to interactively adjust these parameters, and have the composited video (played back continuously) reflect these changes with as little latency as possible.  In my current implementation there is a significant lag between slider adjustments and the video image responding. Presumably this is because the video player has already processed and buffered frames using the previous parameter values.  I am hoping to find an approach that would allow smooth and responsive adjustments of the CIFilter parameter(s) while the video is playing. Maybe there is some instruction that would flush the player's cache (without interrupting playback)?  Amongst other things I tried setting the AVPlayerItem’s preferredForwardBufferDuration to a very low value (such as 0.01), but this seemed to have no effect on the responsiveness of adjustments.   Here is a simplified example project that only has a single slider for controlling foreground exposure : https://www.dropbox.com/s/bk3srki6ys455sr/VideoCompositing.zip?dl=1|https://www.dropbox.com/s/bk3srki6ys455sr/VideoCompositing.zip?dl=1

I have a specific question when it comes to capturing data simultaneously from multiple AVCaptureDevice objects. On iOS we have AVCaptureMultiCamSession.  But I am more interested in macOS. Since that API is not available for macOS, what is the best way to achieve the same result i.e. mapping multiple simultaneous input devices to multiple outputs. Would I have to run a single AVCaptureSession and do my own management of adding multiple inputs and mapping each input to its own distinct output device ?

    we have some devices which provide audio and video samples which are synced with one another but not with the host clock. So the audio sample rate is not e.g. 48kHz, but something close to it. Microphones usually provide a feedback pipe so that the host can tell the device to djust its output sample rate to match the host clock rate; these devices cannot do that. Can we just measure the incoming sample rate and tell CoreAudio that it is (e.g.) 48012 Hz for some seconds and 48006 Hz for some seconds, etc, or can it not to do rate matching?

    I am building a Music Visualizer (for macOS and iOS as well as any future Apple platforms that would support immersive Metal powered visualization)   I have been wondering about how to properly support Apple Music instead of merely internet streams and purchased iTunes music. There is wonderful support for integrating with Apple Music to allow the user to select tracks and playlists etc. I have not found a way to actually tap into the audio buffers to do the analysis (e.g. FFT) that I need. Common sense tells me there could be fully understandable legal reasons for this, but I still want to ask for your advice on how to best support Apple Music, now that I have this brief window of time. Perhaps there is a way to get access to "reduced information" about the audio signal somehow without my app actually accessing the raw buffers?  A workaround using the microphone incurs a lag in responsiveness and results in very poor audio with headphones. (I use AudioKit, but this seems to be a general issue even when activating the mic in System Preferences).  Thank you!

    Hello all, hope everyone is doing well, i would like anyone's input on streaming audio through MQTT messages. I have created a working class that uses AudioQueue to grab packets of a certain size and listen to these bytes after applying an algorithm to it. I've done this for talking and listening using AudioQueue only. However, sometimes there could be some instability when listening and talking. Does anyone have any improvements or things i can look out for when handling live streamed audio data with AudioQueue? Or is this the right service for streaming audio? Just for context, I've tried AVAudioEngine but a few issues arose when doing so. Thanks!

    Hi! I have a fairly technical question that might have been a better fit for a lab, but I missed the deadline on Monday to apply for it. :pensive:  I am using a custom Core Image compositing pipeline (via the AVVideoCompositing protocol) that is using CIFilters for adjusting a foreground and background video and combine them via alpha blending/masking.  The custom compositor has some parameters stored in an instance conforming to the AVVideoCompositionInstructionProtocol.  The goal is for the user to interactively adjust these parameters, and have the composited video (played back continuously) reflect these changes with as little latency as possible.  In my current implementation there is a significant lag between slider adjustments and the video image responding. Presumably this is because the video player has already processed and buffered frames using the previous parameter values.  I am hoping to find an approach that would allow smooth and responsive adjustments of the CIFilter parameter(s) while the video is playing. Maybe there is some instruction that would flush the player's cache (without interrupting playback)?  Amongst other things I tried setting the AVPlayerItem’s preferredForwardBufferDuration to a very low value (such as 0.01), but this seemed to have no effect on the responsiveness of adjustments.   Here is a simplified example project that only has a single slider for controlling foreground exposure : https://www.dropbox.com/s/bk3srki6ys455sr/VideoCompositing.zip?dl=1|https://www.dropbox.com/s/bk3srki6ys455sr/VideoCompositing.zip?dl=1

    I have a question regarding SharePlay experience in a documents app that doesn't provide an features like collaborative editing or sharing links to the document yet.  iOS 15 case: Let's say the user starts SharePlay session with another person, which joins to edit this document as a guest. Which means that whenever the season is over, the guest won't be able to suggest edits to the other user, so that we finish editing experience and give him an option to copy text or create his own copy of the doc.  My question is how can we improve that user experience on iOS 15, improving the flow itself? And what are we capable of in iOS 16 - what would be the desired flow for editor's users and should we use collaboration api instead/combined?

    I am building a Music Visualizer (for macOS and iOS as well as any future Apple platforms that would support immersive Metal powered visualization)   I have been wondering about how to properly support Apple Music instead of merely internet streams and purchased iTunes music. There is wonderful support for integrating with Apple Music to allow the user to select tracks and playlists etc. I have not found a way to actually tap into the audio buffers to do the analysis (e.g. FFT) that I need. Common sense tells me there could be fully understandable legal reasons for this, but I still want to ask for your advice on how to best support Apple Music, now that I have this brief window of time. Perhaps there is a way to get access to "reduced information" about the audio signal somehow without my app actually accessing the raw buffers?  A workaround using the microphone incurs a lag in responsiveness and results in very poor audio with headphones. (I use AudioKit, but this seems to be a general issue even when activating the mic in System Preferences).  Thank you!

<p>The Apple Music API is a separate product from any other metadata APIs. We currently don’t have a dedicated Podcasts API, but if you need podcast metadata you can leverage the pre-existing iTunes Search API -

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H96G1FB7|:
Hello &lt;@U03JE7H2DM4&gt;!</p>
<p>Apple Music content is typically protected, and requires specialized playback logic. That’s why it’s not possible to play Apple Music content with AVPlayer. Instead, you should use one of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickit|MusicKit">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickit|MusicKit</a>’s players, like:
• <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickit/applicationmusicplayer|ApplicationMusicPlayer">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickit/applicationmusicplayer|ApplicationMusicPlayer</a>
• <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickit/systemmusicplayer|SystemMusicPlayer">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickit/systemmusicplayer|SystemMusicPlayer</a></p>

<p>|U03JE7H2DM4|:
Will those players ever be able to play audio directly from a url like AVPlayer?</p>
<p>|U03H96G1FB7|:
Those players do not currently allow playing audio directly from a URL like <code>AVPlayer</code>.</p>
<p>What use-case do you have for that? And more generally, what are you trying to achieve?</p>
<p>|U03JE7H2DM4|:
Essentially, a single player that can play the protected Apple Music songs and freely available content (url) in the same queue. I know it's possible using a mix of AVPlayer and System/ApplicationMusicPlayer but it would be really cool if we could do it in a single player.</p>
<p>|U03H96G1FB7|:
Ok, I see, thanks &lt;@U03JE7H2DM4&gt;.</p>
<p>I think the best way forward would be to capture this information about your use-case in a new ticket on <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant">https://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant</a>.

Yes, we have worked hard with business to make sure it is compliant with licensing agreement for use in your app.

<p>|U03JBMMB10A|:

<p>|U03K8THM8F2|:
Hi Rudrank, Tyson and Everyone,
Please reference <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/</a>  section 4.5.2 for guidance of how artist images can be used in your app.</p>
<pre><code>(ii) Using the MusicKit APIs is not a replacement for securing the licenses you might need for a deeper or more complex music integration. For example, if you want your app to play a specific song at a particular moment, or to create audio or video files that can be shared to social media, you'll need to contact rights-holders directly to get their permission (e.g. synchronization or adaptation rights) and assets. Cover art and other metadata may only be used in connection with music playback or playlists (including App Store screenshots displaying your app's functionality), and should not be used in any marketing or advertising without getting specific authorization from rights-holders. Make sure to follow the Apple Music Identity Guidelines when integrating Apple Music services in your app.
</code></pre>
<p>|U03HMDM1J23|:
Got it, thanks!</p>

Right, that’s great because we used to have run all our AppStore screenshots though photoshop to change all the album artwork to public domain images. So we really appreciate this! Thank you!</p>

Ugh sorry wrong lounge :man-facepalming:</p>
<p>|U03HEF3RZKN|:
No worries! I can still answer this a little bit, we do not currently have any API for this in SharePlay, but one idea you could do is add the share URL to your <code>GroupActivity</code>! You can then use the share URL to gain access on the other devices by accepting the share. Alternatively, we definitely encourage you to check out the new collaboration features in Messages offered this year! This way, people on a FaceTime call can easily get the option to share the <code>CKShare</code> with the group they’re FaceTime’ing with from the share sheet!</p>
<p>|U03J4E99F9S|:
Thanks. Not sure how that integrates with iCloud documents (wasn't so much the wrong place given SharePlay, just feels odd in the AV lounge!)</p>

It seems there is no recommended solution for doing such collab with iCloud documents which is puzzling </p>

<p>|U03HEF3T0GL|:
2X speed Adam is always fun!</p>
<p>SharePlay in Messages provides the same guarantees you're used to as a developer! You'll still be leveraging the Apple infrastructure for messaging through the GroupSessionMessenger with end-to-end encryption, <em>regardless of whether SharePlay was initiated from FaceTime or Messages!</em></p>
<p>|U03J1USNBDZ|:
&gt; just to clarify... our app is a presentation manager enabling file sharing and group editing (aka Multiuser Quick Look) and also supporting a realtime SharePlay canvas for drawing... so we support deep FaceTime programmatic access beyond the 15.4 GroupActivitySharingController... so we currently associate file editing with who is FaceTime/SharePlay/iCloud user... so just to be clear... is FaceTime the transport for SharePlay or do we need to also manager Messages identity?</p>
<p>|U03J1USNBDZ|:
... because Messages and FaceTime can be different email/phone numbers</p>

&gt; Hi Chris,
&gt; Subtitles and closed caption playback using AVPlayerLayer adapt to the corresponding HDR video. If you are seeing cases where this is a concern, please file use Feedback Assistant to describe the situation you are seeing. A sample app and especially a pointer to the asset will be most helpful. Please include the platform(s) you are using.

Hi John. Thanks for your question. This is an interesting problem.
1. It is difficult to get correct latency values for AirPods right now. Would you please file an enhancement request for this (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/">https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/</a>)?
2. Can you elaborate how you are playing audio in your app? Is it by any chance using AVPlayer?</p>
<p>|U03J1RX038W|:
Hi Moritz, thanks! I filed FB8961041 about 6 months ago. There's more detail and a sample project there if you want to check it out.</p>
<p>So far I've been looking at outputLatency and ioBufferDuration from AVAudioSession but they only add up to around 20ms whereas the actual latency is somewhere around 110ms. I have read (I think from Jeff Moore) that some or all of the remainder comes from "safety offsets" but I don't see that those are exposed anywhere.</p>
<p>Basically this has been holding up a couple of music-related apps that I'm working. I simplified the problem space somewhat for the sake of brevity, but input latency plays into it too.</p>
<p>|U03J1RX038W|:
I will note that standard videos on iOS sync to Airpods sound quite reliably so I know this is doable :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03HQNTMT6V|:
Thank you very much for the FB number.</p>
<p>|U03HQNTMT6V|:
Note that AVFoundation playback objects like AVPlayer or AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer handle latency for you.
So, if you can use one of those for rendering your audio, you can rely on the AVPlayerItem timebase or AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer currentTime to synchronize your graphics.</p>

I have a fairly technical question that might have been a better fit for a lab, but I missed the deadline on Monday to apply for it. :pensive:  I am using a custom Core Image compositing pipeline (via the AVVideoCompositing protocol) that is using CIFilters for adjusting a foreground and background video and combine them via alpha blending/masking.  The custom compositor has some parameters stored in an instance conforming to the AVVideoCompositionInstructionProtocol.  The goal is for the user to interactively adjust these parameters, and have the composited video (played back continuously) reflect these changes with as little latency as possible.  In my current implementation there is a significant lag between slider adjustments and the video image responding. Presumably this is because the video player has already processed and buffered frames using the previous parameter values.  I am hoping to find an approach that would allow smooth and responsive adjustments of the CIFilter parameter(s) while the video is playing. Maybe there is some instruction that would flush the player's cache (without interrupting playback)?  Amongst other things I tried setting the AVPlayerItem’s preferredForwardBufferDuration to a very low value (such as 0.01), but this seemed to have no effect on the responsiveness of adjustments.   Here is a simplified example project that only has a single slider for controlling foreground exposure : <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bk3srki6ys455sr/VideoCompositing.zip?dl=1|https://www.dropbox.com/s/bk3srki6ys455sr/VideoCompositing.zip?dl=1">https://www.dropbox.com/s/bk3srki6ys455sr/VideoCompositing.zip?dl=1|https://www.dropbox.com/s/bk3srki6ys455sr/VideoCompositing.zip?dl=1</a></h4>

G'day, Hendrik.
Thanks for your question.  It's cool to hear about your advanced use of AVVideoCompositing.
I want to point out that it isn't too late yet to request a timeslot in the Thursday AVFoundation Playback lab.
Regarding your request to reduce the latency for rendering during user interaction: would you please file an enhancement request via the feedback assistant, and include the sample app that you have already built?</p>

G'day, Daniel.
Check out AVAssetResourceLoader.  Through it, you can provide a delegate that will be called to interpret a custom URL scheme and deliver data that you will read from your custom document format.
There is a new API property in iOS 16 and macOS 13 Ventura called entireLengthAvailableOnDemand which optimizes the case where the data is already available locally, as in your app.</p>

<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
Hi Neil. In AVPlayerItemOutput.h, there is some sample code above the declaration of <code>AVPlayerItemVideoOutput0</code>. Using <code>AVPlayerItemVideoOutput</code>'s <code>copyPixelBufferForItemTime:itemTimeForDisplay:</code>, you you should be able to grab what I believe comes out as the PTS.</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
If you want to work more on this with us, you could come back and ask us this question to either the AVFoundation Playback lab on Thursday or the HTTP Live Streaming lab on Friday :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
Thanks. I'm still trying to find the code you're talking about (had to create an obj-c project to view the h file).</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
I think I found it. Thanks</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
Would these calls have any impact on the performance of the video playback?</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
Our interest is in sussing out the source of an audio/video desynchronisation issue we're having.</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
The only way to know for sure is to try it out and profile, but I would not think that using <code>AVPlayerItemVideoOutput</code> would have a major impact on playback performance.</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
If you can determine that your content is not at fault, could you Feedback Assistant report?</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
At this point we're not really sure. We have a feedback ticket open, but we have not come up with a cause yet. There is a desire from some of the people on our team to know the PTS etc.
In our case, we have AAC-LC that throws decoding errors and drifting out of sync only when DRM (fairplay) is enabled. If the stream is clear, everything is fine. If we switch to HE-AAC, we're not seeing these issues and it's not clear to me why this would be or why DRM would make it happen/worse</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
Could you share the FB ID of your feedback ticket?</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
I should note that AVPlayerItemVideoOutput will not work with FairPlay.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
FB9995441</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
Ah ok, good to know</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
In case we run out of time here, I highly encourage you to come to the HTTP Live Streaming Lab on Friday to discuss this further.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
I have submitted a request for that lab.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
...and the AVFoundation playback lab</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
Excellent.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
We have multiple pipelines...one for live content, and one for vod content....we only experience this on live content, but the pipelines are different vendors etc...so I would think it's some kind of configuration issue...but the whole DRM vs Clear throws that into doubt</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
Did you make any progress on debugging the audio decode errors?</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
I have not, no. It was suggested that it was an encoding issue, but I don't see why it would be ok when playing clear streams.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
Also, my understanding is that HE-AAC is just a more feature rich version of AAC-LC, so I don't know why that change would make a difference</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
Perhaps there is an issue with the audio encoder that is only hit with the configuration of AAC-LC+FairPlay? We are definitively seeing bad data fed into our audio decoder, but I cannot tell you why.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
And so is the audio data the same whether or not DRM is applied, or are they structurally different?</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
My assumption was just that DRM would need to be decrypted first and then it's the same data as clear</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
Do you have two audio streams of what you consider to be byte-for-byte identical, one clear-text and one encrypted?</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
Identical aside from their encryption, that is.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
In our lab we have 2 channels side by side...one clear and one Fairplay. I believe i noted the exact URLs in the FB</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
but they should be identical in every way except drm</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
I'm taking a look at the media segments. But I suspect we'll run out of time.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
Thanks...I appreciate any info we discover in the time allotted...</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
The HTTP Live Streaming lab would be the best venue to continue this conversation :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
The initial question I have on my request for that one is different than what we're discussing today. Will that matter?</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
This particular issue I have requested for the playback lab</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
If possible, ask this question again in a new question, so we can appropriately prepare.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
ok, sounds good...I'll create a new request</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
thanks</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
Thanks! Have a nice rest of your day.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
It doesn't seem to let me request more than one appointment? do i cancel and create new?</p>
<p>|U03HHD75JEB|:
Yeah, that will work.</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
ok, thanks</p>

G'day, Mitchell.
I am curious about the destination URL that you're providing to AVAssetExportSession.  It looks to me like this error indicates that our frameworks were unable to access that URL.  Can you check that it's a URL that your app has access to -- for example, if you need a temporary filename, are you using NSTemporaryDirectory() to generate it?</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
Yes! So I spent about three hours yesterday messing with this as with research thought this was the error too. I have tried every combination of different URLs and all had the same problem. I will paste what i’ve tried below.</p>
<p>However, to test if this was the problem, I tried copying the data I already had to one of these url’s and reading it back and it worked. So I thought that the problem was not the output URL that I was writing too.</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
Here is everything I tried:</p>
<p>//  let compressedURL = NSURL.fileURL(withPath: NSTemporaryDirectory() + NSUUID().uuidString + “.mov”)
//  let compressedURL = URL(string: NSTemporaryDirectory())?.appendingPathComponent(“Library/Caches/compressedVideo101.mov”)</p>
<p>//  let exportPath = NSTemporaryDirectory().appendingFormat(“video.mov”)
//  let compressedURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: exportPath)</p>
<p>//  let documentDirectoryURL = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first! as NSURL
//  let compressedURL = documentDirectoryURL.appendingPathComponent(“compressionVideos/compressedvideo2.mov”)! as URL</p>
<p>//  let docPath: String = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.documentDirectory, .userDomainMask, true)[0];
//  let compressedURL: URL = URL(fileURLWithPath: docPath).appendingPathComponent(“video_output.mov”);</p>
<p>//  let temporaryDirectoryUrl: URL = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory
//  let temporaryFilename = ProcessInfo().globallyUniqueString
//  let compressedURL = temporaryDirectoryUrl.appendingPathComponent(“(temporaryFilename).mov”)</p>
<p><code>*let* documentsPath = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first</code>
  <code>*let* compressedURL = documentsPath!.appendingPathComponent("compressedvideo4", isDirectory: *false*).appendingPathExtension("mov")</code></p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
The last one, the uncommented one, is the one I am currently using because i was able to successfully copy the data to it and read it back properly which makes me think assume it works.</p>
<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:
Can you give an example of the URLs that these are generating for you?</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
Could there possibly be a permissions problem with my app that is preventing the export session from writing to it?</p>
<p>And yes! I’ll provide a URL. Is the app ID generated in the URL sensitive information that I shouldn’t provide to the somewhat public setting of the WWDC lounge? Need to keep certain aspects of the app confidential.</p>
<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:
Feel free to XXXX out whole words of the URL that might leak anything.</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
Great! Here are two different URLs, one for the temporary directory and one for the documents directory.</p>
<p>This is for the tmp directory and was created using this code: <code>let compressedURL = NSURL.fileURL(withPath: NSTemporaryDirectory() + NSUUID().uuidString + ".mov")</code></p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
sorry one moment send pressed too early</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
For the tmp directory created using the code above:</p>
<p><code>file:///private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/XXXXXXXX/tmp/XXXXXXX.mov</code></p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
This is for the docs directory created using this code:</p>
<p><code>*let* documentsPath = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).first</code>
  <code>*let* compressedURL = documentsPath!.appendingPathComponent("compressedvideo4", isDirectory: *false*).appendingPathExtension("mov")</code></p>
<p>URL:
<code>file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/XXXXXXXXXXXX/Documents/compressedvideo4.mov</code></p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
Is that the information you wanted to see?</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
Still producing this error</p>
<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:
If I understand correctly, you have a bunch of attempts to generate a temporary URL which aren't working, but one last one that does work, but seems like not the right place to put the temporary file?</p>
<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:
Sorry, it looks like I misread you.  The last one doesn't work but you were able to confirm that your app can write there</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
&lt;@U03HRD4PZLN&gt; I know I can write to the last one because of the copy test, but all of them produce the error. Whether a temporary URL or not, all of them produce the error message I pasted above</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
Yes exactly!</p>
<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:
OK.  A puzzle!</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
I have not yet done a test with the temporary URLs but I can if that helps, I assume most of them would work also</p>
<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:
Maybe the destination isn't the problematic variable, then.  What can you tell about the source asset?</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
The asset is a video, taken from the user’s photo library using PHPickerViewController which writes it to a URL on the system which I know I am able to read from because I am able to get raw data from it.</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
The video is about 11 seconds long and about 20MB</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:
URL of the source:</p>
<p>file:///private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/XXXXXXX/tmp/.com.apple.Foundation.NSItemProvider.lobgL0/IMG_0061.mov</p>
<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:
We seem to be stumped too -- and we are running out of time in this lounge.  Can I ask for you to file a feedback assistant report including a sysdiagnose, and if possible, a sample project that reproduces this?</p>
<p>|U03JRSDS7JQ|:

<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:

Since that API is not available for macOS, what is the best way to achieve the same result i.e. mapping multiple simultaneous input devices to multiple outputs.

So the audio sample rate is not e.g. 48kHz, but something close to it. Microphones usually provide a feedback pipe so that the host can tell the device to djust its output sample rate to match the host clock rate; these devices cannot do that. Can we just measure the incoming sample rate and tell CoreAudio that it is (e.g.) 48012 Hz for some seconds and 48006 Hz for some seconds, etc, or can it not to do rate matching?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:
G'day, Stuart.
Our traditional strategy underlying A/V sync is to synchronize video to audio, wherever possible, because adjusting video timing is generally simpler and lower-impact than adjusting audio.  In this approach, we allow the sequence of audio samples to define the timeline of the recorded movie, and the timestamps of video frames are recorded relative to that.
It's not clear to me from your question whether you're asking about a scenario of capture, or playback, or something real-time?</p>
<p>|U03HVCWP48N|:
I think he might be asking what strategy AVFoundation or CoreAudio uses to re-sync the samples.  Does it drop a slice and interpolate the waveform?  Does it play the sample at a lower rate, or perform a full retime / resample?  In a formal, professional production environment, this simply doesn't happen because pro gear is synced together with clocks to eliminate <em><em>jitter</em></em> and ensure accurate sampling rates.  Consumer gear doesn't have such a stringent requirement.</p>
<p>|U03HVCWP48N|:
If you're saying the audio is inviolate and sacred, then video is expected to drop frames.  But he has a point; if some piece of audio equipment records at the wrong sample rate, what's the solution?</p>
<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:
Speaking generically: yes, in those cases I'd expect that someone would need to resample it.</p>
<p>|U03JDS776JH|:
it is real time playback and capture of incoming video and audio from AV capture hardware. Realtime playback never seems to be a problem, but we have problems with A/V desync, particularly if we are synchronizing another audio source</p>
<p>|U03HVCWP48N|:
&lt;@U03JDS776JH&gt;: if this is realtime in a studio environment, you might want to invest in something like a "master clock" or "time code generator."</p>
<p>|U03JDS776JH|:
because that second audio source is often a microphone, and a microphone usually delivers exactly the host’s idea of the requested sample rate. So I guess what I’m asking is can I expect Core Audio to smoothly and seamlessly rate match if I mix two samples with slightly different sample rates (e.g. 48 and 48.003 kHz), where the not-quite-48kHz sample rate may vary from minute to minute as we measure?</p>
<p>|U03HVCWP48N|:
Is it a <em>directly-attached</em> USB microphone like a Blue Yeti, or something attached with an XLR cable to a preamp, and if so, is that preamp USB or Thunderbolt?</p>
<p>|U03HVCWP48N|:
(the underlying issue is probably the hardware introducing clock drift, which should not happen)</p>
<p>|U03JDS776JH|:
second audio channel is usually an external USB microphone. Primary audio channel is synced to the primary video.</p>
<p>|U03HVCWP48N|:
The recording sampling rate will be determined by the project definitions (Logic Pro, Avid, etc) and it's reasonable to assume that you are recording all devices simultaneously within the tracking session.  Therefore, <em><em>all hardware is expected to sample at the same rate</em></em>.  If this drift is only happening with one external device, then it's the device, not you.</p>
<p>|U03JDS776JH|:
even if the capture source’s audio did not drift, we can never guarantee that its output rate matches the computer’s. Even if the capture source’s audio rate were drift-free, the host clock can drift. With USB microphones, a feedback pipe requests a few more or a few less samples from the hardware to match the host’s expectations, and the USB microphone adjusts its PLL accordingly. This isn’t possible if the audio sample rate is dictated by another piece of hardware.</p>
<p>|U03HRD4PZLN|:
I think I'm going to recommend that you sign up for a slot in the Core Audio lab on Thursday, &lt;@U03JDS776JH&gt;.  Though I was not entirely clear which interface you're integrating at: e.g., an audio device, a CoreMediaIO DAL plugin, an app calling AVCapture, an app calling CoreAudio?</p>
<p>|U03HVCWP48N|:
Sounds like you have two pieces of hardware fighting for the role of master clock in this situation.  In the Audio MIDI Setup app, it shows the 'default' clock source for each device.  Your recording app should be able to determine which one plays the role of master clock.</p>
<p>|U03HVCWP48N|:
Unfortunately that's not possible from the AMS app.</p>
<p>|U03HVCWP48N|:
All you can really do is set the preferred sample rate.</p>
<p>|U03JDS776JH|:
An app using CoreAudio. The question is can Core Audio resample without glitches if we continually update the sample rate. The audio channel from our device - our app generates audio and video samples from it, the audio channels don’t appear in AMS. So we can describe the samples as having a rate of 48003 per second if we want to. The question is whether core audio can deal with on-the-fly changes of the order of 0 to 30ppm happening on a minute-by-minute basis, or does it cause discontinuities in the output?</p>
<p>|U03HVCWP48N|:
That's <em>definitely</em> a question for the labs.  :lab_coat: :test_tube: :loud_sound:</p>
<p>|U03JDS776JH|:
super I will try to book one</p>

<p>|U03J213RF18|:
So all video bitrates are associated with both the AAC group and the AC-3 group. When getting the audio tracks from AVPlayer, it only returns a single track for English (so whichever the system chose). Now if we wanted to present the user with the option of selecting the Stereo or Surround renditions from a menu, we'd need both to be returned when asking for those tracks. If I change the name of the surround one to English Surround, then I get both tracks. Am I using it correctly, or should the various audio tracks all be in the same group with different NAMEs?</p>
<p>|U03J213RF18|:
And if they do have separate names, do we lose on the system auto selecting the best audio track for playback?</p>

Hi Eddie, unfortunately we don’t have any code snippets for interacting with MLMultiArray in AVFoundation. If you are looking for info for how to use MLMultiArray, there are Machine Learning &amp; Computer Vision labs on Thursday and Friday that you might like to check out. For the audio itself, what form is it in (.mov, .mp4, AudioFile supported formats such as CAF, etc.) and are you reading it all at once or processing it over time?</p>

Hello Peter,
You could share the ad schedules across the group when playback starts using the GroupSessionMessenger. And when a participant without ads is waiting for the others to finish, you can show a countdown timer based on the schedules shared.</p>

<p>|U03HEF3RZKN|:
&lt;@U03JER2C7MX&gt;, love that you’re thinking through all the edge cases! I think it’s a great idea to consider cases where the connection can be temporarily lost, we’ve commonly come across this in scenarios like people riding on subways, going into elevators, etc. People connecting through FaceTime can be in very dynamic situations where the network can go in and out, so it is important to think of an architecture that can support these cases.</p>
<p>One topic that we recommend looking into is <em>CRDTs</em>, they can be a little intimidating at first, but they basic idea is to structure your data in a way that is resilient to being sent redundantly and can handle cases like trying to edit the same selection of text at the same time.</p>
<p>We’re always happy to chat in more technical detail about these concepts and edge cases in our labs as well! If you haven’t already, feel free to register for the SharePlay lab on Friday and we’ll make sure you get a slot!</p>

Hello Nathan,
You should be able to do this by removing the <code>"playingInterstitial"</code> suspension from <code>AVPlaybackCoordinator.suspensionReasonsThatTriggerWaiting</code> , and issuing a play command to the previously waiting participant.
But we would strongly recommend to synchronize the ad timings across participants.
You could also try issuing <code>AVPlayer.playImmediatelyAtRate:</code> at the waiting participant to force them to play.</p>

Hi &lt;@U03JXLMAJBE&gt;,
Thanks for your question, tell us more about the experience you would like to build based on the info panel visibility and the platform(s) you are targeting?</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
&lt;@U03JXLMAJBE&gt; There is currently no way to track the visibility of the transport controls. That’s great feedback though. As Gavin mentioned, we’re interested in understanding your use case better. Could you give some more details about it?</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
Hi &lt;@U03HQNTQK33&gt; and &lt;@U03HC3KUDGB&gt;. I have a pretty simple use-case. On tvOS platform, I want to show a custom overlay view over the top of AVPlayer view when playback controls and info panel are hidden. When the playback controls or info-panel appear I want to hide the custom overlay view and show it again when they hide.</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
Im currently doing through didUpdateFocus by comparing the nextFocused and previousFocused views, but its not really full proof.</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
The new player updates introduced with tvOS 15, didnt work with my previously build logic which works for tvOS 13 and 14. Now I have two separate logic for different players. I wish there was a callback like ‘func playerViewController(_ playerViewController: AVPlayerViewController, willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar visible: Bool, with coordinator: AVPlayerViewControllerAnimationCoordinator)’. It will just make it so simple</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
&lt;@U03HQNTQK33&gt; ^^</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
&lt;@U03HC3KUDGB&gt;</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
Hey Aalim, so sorry for the late reply! Just to clarify, you’re looking for a way to know when the tvOS player in tvOS 13/14 will show/hide the info panel that pulls down from the top. Is that correct?</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
With an API like <code>func playerViewController(_ playerViewController: AVPlayerViewController, willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar visible: Bool, with coordinator: AVPlayerViewControllerAnimationCoordinator)</code> ?</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
Yes. thats correct and not just for tvOS 13/14 but also for tvOS 15</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
&lt;@U03HQNTQK33&gt;</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
Ah I see. So, unfortunately, we can’t update tvOS 13 or 14 with any new features (since it’s already shipped and on peoples devices). For tvOS 15.0 and later though we’ve removed the info panel that drops down from the top in AVPlayerViewController - we now have an info tab integrated into the transport bar. You should be able to use <code>func playerViewController(_ playerViewController: AVPlayerViewController, willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar visible: Bool, with coordinator: AVPlayerViewControllerAnimationCoordinator)</code>  when the transport bar is shown/hidden though</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
No I have looked at this method even on tvOS 15. It just works for playback controls not for info-panel.</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
&lt;@U03HQNTQK33&gt;</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
So in the new player, your looking to be able to know when the new info tab is opened?</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
correct.</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
If the transport bar is hidden the info tab is also hidden.</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
On tvOS 15.0 and later</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
The delegate method willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar will be called when the transport controls visibility changes. The info tab will only ever be shown while the transport bars visibility is YES. So the other would look like this</p>
<p>willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar: YES // transport bar is about to appear
// User clicks info tab, it appears
// User exits info tab, it disappears
willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar: NO // transport bar is about to hide</p>
<p>You should be able to use the delegate callback willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar to determine if the info panel is not. If the transport bar is hidden the info tab is also hidden.</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
In tvOS 15, There are two ways to go to info panel,
1: swipe down when playback controls are visible
2: swipe down when playback controls are not visible.</p>
<p>In the first case, when you swipe down from transport bar  willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar gets called but the value of visible is false since, transport bar hides when info panel appears.</p>
<p>In the second case, the willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar doesn’t even gets called.</p>
<p>|U03JXLMAJBE|:
&lt;@U03HQNTQK33&gt;</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
That’s correct, with the current behavior of willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar you can determine whether or not the entire transport bar is hidden or visible. Unfortunately you can’t determine if any of our provided customInfoViewControllers are hidden or shown.</p>
<p>However, in tvOS 15.0 and later with an app linking against tvOS 15.0 and later, if willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar has recently returned false then the info tab is guaranteed to be hidden. The info tab is only ever shown when the transport bar is visible because it is part of the transport bar UI at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>If the behavior I just described above is not working in the new tvOS 16.0 beta or if you need more granular callbacks for when individual customInfoViewControllers (like the info tab) are selected then I would definitely file a request in Feedback Assistant - that’s valuable feedback!</p>

<p>|U03HEF3RZKN|:
Thanks for the detailed question, &lt;@U03JER2C7MX&gt;! There’s some more relevant details on this too in response to &lt;@U03HC3KUDGB&gt;’s question above, but it sounds like a prime example for adopting the new Messages collaboration APIs! In this case, the user doesn’t need to have an existing account in your app (e.g. they can still be a guest), but sharing the document over a Messages group will let your app get an identity for this user based on the real Messages identity, so you can ensure they can still access the document even after a SharePlay session has ended.</p>

<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
Hey &lt;@U03HVCK66P8&gt;, could you give us some more detail about your use case? We’d like to understand your application better.</p>
<p>Some streams have multiple quality variants and based on the current state of the system and network we may choose higher or lower quality streams.</p>
<p>|U03HVCK66P8|:
For example, the Apple Developer App.</p>
<p>|U03HVCK66P8|:
Cannot do fullscreen / adjust quality</p>
<p>|U03HVCK66P8|:
&lt;@U03HQNTQK33&gt;</p>
<p>|U03HVCK66P8|:
Becoz the video always loads in low quality and then becomes high after a period.</p>
<p>|U03HVCK66P8|:
I tried both apps (iOS/macOS/web), even the new player cannot change too.</p>

Thus, I can only download the video, and it just takes a few seconds.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HEF3RZKN|:
Great question, &lt;@U03JLRZJHQR&gt;! The GroupActivity on the session is safe, and even encouraged, to be updated after the session begins! We’ve done work under the hood to make sure after one person updates it everyone ends up in the right state. It’s important to note that you don’t want to update it too frequently, where too many people could stomp on each other’s toes — we use a form of conflict resolution known as <em>last writer wins.</em> This means that the last person to update the activity will win, and all others will see that latest activity. So if two people update it at the same time, you’ll only see one. However, everyone will be guaranteed to be in the same state so you don’t have to worry about that!</p>
<p>This can be a great way to infrequently update the “state” of the group, e.g. for a Music playing app you can update it to whatever song is playing so everyone transitions to the correct song.</p>

Great, thanks for the detailed reply!</p>

Perhaps there is a way to get access to "reduced information" about the audio signal somehow without my app actually accessing the raw buffers?

There’s no need to mix in noise at any stage in the creation of custom catalogs, clean audio is always preferred. Shazam is noise tolerant (you’ve used the app in a noisy setting and still received a match I’m sure). So have a clean audio reference signature, and try and make sure that the query signature is as clean as possible, but it can tolerate a certain amount of noise.</p>

DeviceDiscoveryUI only supports having one device connected to the Apple TV at a time.</p>

Sorry google search didn’t reveal the docs for some reason. I’ve found them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J1T8T77A|:
Good question! The app icon that shows on the TV is the icon of your tvOS app that's presenting the picker.</p>
<p>|U03JPBUSHLZ|:
Thanks, Eric. It was a silly question -- google search didn’t reveal the docs for some reason. I’ve found them and I understand now :sweat_smile:</p>
<p>|U03HQNWPDBK|:
No worries!  Hopefully they've helped clear up any questions you have, and if you have any further, don't hesitate to ask ^_^</p>
<p>|U03J1T8T77A|:
All good! Feel free to post on the Forums too after WWDC, if there are any other questions. We're happy to help!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HQNWPDBK|:
The connection is allowed to exist for long as the application is running on both the tv and the selected device. Once the application has been suspended, the connection will be terminated. If your app has been granted extended runtime, say for example through the use of a workout session, then that connection will persist while the device has its screen off.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J1T8T77A|:
Hey Duncan, we hear you loud and clear! Right now, DeviceDiscoveryUI supports a connection between a TV and a single device at a time. If the other devices are running iOS and iPadOS, it is possible to use a &lt;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwbrowser/descriptor/bonjour_type_domain
|Bonjour browse descriptor&gt; as shown in the iOS/iPadOS version of the &lt;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/building_a_custom_peer-to-peer_protocol
|TicTacToe sample app&gt;.  It'd be great if you could submit a Feedback for us so we can take this into consideration for future releases.</p>
<p>|U03JWCQ8ZPY|:
That would be amazing! To have collaborative  sessions between multiple devices with a single Apple TV, it would make the Apple TV a video game console (Make sure you add an amazing GPU in the next versions too :heart:)! And will make the Apple TV more competitive agains the most used ones like Roku and Chrome Cast and Amazon Fire.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
Hey Michael, we’d like to understand more about your use case. Would all of the videos need to play at once, or just one at a time or a collection of a few?</p>
<p>|U03JEEUJPMJ|:
:wave::skin-tone-3: Multiple playing at once. What I have in mind is a full-screen grid, 3-4 columns wide, with rows of squares of videos playing.</p>
<p>(Only those on-screen would need to be playing simultaneously; audio doesn’t matter here – but the idea would be to have it appear, when scrolling, as though all of the videos are all playing at the same time– as in, they begin playing when they come on-screen)</p>
<p>|U03JEEUJPMJ|:
(3 columns * roughly 7 rows =&gt; 21 videos playing simultaneously give-or-take / 4 columns * roughly 9 rows =&gt; 36)</p>
<p>|U03JEEUJPMJ|:
Wondering mainly about the feasibility; in terms of smooth playback &amp; not <em>eating</em> battery– as in, does this sound within the realm of the APIs + the hardware’s capability on iPhone, or would it likely involve falling back to software decoding [or just struggling] behind the scenes</p>
<p>[Oh, more context: I’m envisioning H.264/HEVC videos– whichever makes most sense performance-wise]</p>
<p>|U03JEEUJPMJ|:
If the answer to my question isn’t at all clear cut, and is more of a “as you increase the number of simultaneous playback instances, they’ll play smoothly …until they don’t”, then no worries</p>
<p>|U03HQNTMT6V|:
Playing multiple videos at once can be challenging, both from a user perspective and from a performance perspective.</p>
<p>Try to limit the number of videos so that your users don’t get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>To get the best performance, we recommend that you limit how many videos you load at a time. Let’s say you load 2-4 videos at once, only start loading the next one after a previous one has become readyToPlay (AVPlayerItem status property).
Also, try to re-use AVPlayers as much as possible. So instead of creating new players when a new video scrolls into view, re-use an old player of a video that has scrolled out of view (if possible). (edited)</p>
<p>|U03JEEUJPMJ|:
Okay, thanks.</p>
<p>(Re users + overwhelming: these videos would be short, simple, looping clips of people’s headshots– if you know of the Harry Potter franchise; imagine the newspapers in their universe, and how they have ‘moving photos’ on them :relaxed:)</p>

<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
Hey Alexander, we do not support playing videos using the mkv container format. We are interested in understanding your use case though, could you give us some more details about it? For example, what platform would you like support for this on?</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
We’d also recommend putting in a request for this in Feedback Assistant</p>
<p>|U03KC9BKC9E|:
my use case is similar, I use <code>AVPlayer</code> to load audio files, and my users have asked for <code>ogg</code> files support, which is not available out of the box (sorry for hijacking the thread)</p>
<p>|U03HQNTQK33|:
Hey &lt;@U03KC9BKC9E&gt;, thanks for the info. I would definitely file a request in Feedback Assistant requesting support for this. Sounds like a very useful feature!</p>
