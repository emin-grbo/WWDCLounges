    Hi, nice work on the redesign, I've been going through it this morning! I have a question about color.  On this page: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/dark-mode|https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/dark-mode there's the advice "At a minimum, make sure the contrast ratio between colors is no lower than 4.5:1. For custom foreground and background colors, strive for a contrast ratio of 7:1, especially in small text."  I aim for high contrast as much as possible, but 4.5:1 is pretty limiting, and I don't think Apple always follows this rule themselves. Specifically I'm wondering about the systemColors such as systemOrange, systemMint etc, many of which have quite low contrast against white (i.e., in Light Mode). What is the intended purpose of these colours? Is it meant for text/SF Symbols? Because if so, systemMint comes in at 2.02:1 against white. Should we ever even use systemYellow? Or can we just rely on users turning on Increase Contrast if they need to? But maybe someone doesn't want to have to increase contrast for everything just so they can see that darn yellow text.  Any insight on the intended use of these systemColors would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I've implemented them by using different list cell layout to provide a nesting but would welcome other suggestions.  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/layout-and-organization/outline-views|https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/layout-and-organization/outline-views

    I’m a big believer in Human Interface Guidelines. However, I’d like to have some sincere feedback.   1. The all-new version seems dominated by texts. The older version contains a lot of illustrations and animation along with the content, and maybe it would be better to add more images and animation in the new version.   2. I’m so confused that even though this is an all-new version, there are still some images coming from macOS 10.x, with the design from Yosemite. Please update these images to the design after Big Sur.

    Thanks for this Q/A and congrats on all the work being released this week. Part of my day to day work is taking prototypes and being able to communicate findings to groups and teams that may not have an interest in them (yet..). If you're able to share high level insight - I'm curious how the findings from your prototypes are communicated (format, findings, risks) to external teams or even execs. To some extent the prototype itself carries this weight, but in cases where not and in person communication is infrequent - I'm curious how your team tackles this :)

    Hello again, and thanks for your time! I am looking for general design guidelines on building out visuospatial metaphors in a 3D + AR environment. I have a project, http://github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat|github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat, that renders and visualizes an entire code base at once, but there's just so much to see, it gets cluttered and overwhelming! I would really appreciate some time to talk and think about what kinds of things can be presented, hidden, animated, and made otherwise visually appealing for users, such that the tool is less burdensome, and more useful. Cheers!!

I missed the previous Q&amp;As here, there is just so much going on :exploding_head:  I would love to have the design templates available for Affinity Photo and Designer.

I just did a lab to explore this further - one of the suggestions was to adopt a layout/hierarchy similar to the Notes app.   I wanted to ask if there is any API for the file explorer (lists and grid view) that the Notes app uses. I would like to adopt this in a sidebar as well, and move my document-based app away from a tab controller. Thanks.

    Hi, nice work on the redesign, I've been going through it this morning! I have a question about color.  On this page: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/dark-mode|https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/dark-mode there's the advice "At a minimum, make sure the contrast ratio between colors is no lower than 4.5:1. For custom foreground and background colors, strive for a contrast ratio of 7:1, especially in small text."  I aim for high contrast as much as possible, but 4.5:1 is pretty limiting, and I don't think Apple always follows this rule themselves. Specifically I'm wondering about the systemColors such as systemOrange, systemMint etc, many of which have quite low contrast against white (i.e., in Light Mode). What is the intended purpose of these colours? Is it meant for text/SF Symbols? Because if so, systemMint comes in at 2.02:1 against white. Should we ever even use systemYellow? Or can we just rely on users turning on Increase Contrast if they need to? But maybe someone doesn't want to have to increase contrast for everything just so they can see that darn yellow text.  Any insight on the intended use of these systemColors would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

    Thanks for this Q/A and congrats on all the work being released this week. Part of my day to day work is taking prototypes and being able to communicate findings to groups and teams that may not have an interest in them (yet..). If you're able to share high level insight - I'm curious how the findings from your prototypes are communicated (format, findings, risks) to external teams or even execs. To some extent the prototype itself carries this weight, but in cases where not and in person communication is infrequent - I'm curious how your team tackles this :)

<p>For custom symbols, I prefer using Illustrator. But Sketch works well too 
Illustrator’s blending tools are helpfull 
For variable templates that will use interpolation, I personally like to nudge points around in a font editor before going back to Illustrator, this way I get more info on the number of points and the point order 
Illustrator and Glyphs 3 
&lt;@U03JEKW67KJ&gt; Interesting. I’ve never used a font editor, do you have a recommendation? Getting points correct for interpolation an issue I ran into with Sketch. 
I’ve used Glyphs3 (Glyphs App) same as Lance mentioned, but other popular font editors include RoboFont and FontLab. All have fairly good documentation (and forums) so you should be able to get up and running quickly </p>

<p>The SF Pro and SF Compact fonts that are installed with the SF Symbols app are variable!

They are :slightly_smiling_face: 
Out of curiosity, the new SF Symbol variable colors for values from zero-to-one (like volume and signal strength symbols)... are those implemented as a variable font axis? 
Variable color is not available in the fonts, unfortunately. For showing different rendering modes and variable color in design comps, we recommend using the <code>Edit &amp;gt; Copy Image</code> 
Thanks, Paul!

<p>The file created when you choose File &gt; Export Symbol... can be shared with other people. It can be imported back in to the SF Symbols app and should preserve all of the annotations, too! 
Oh nice, so it’s basically an SVG that’s on steroids. :smile: Or is it a different file format? 
Yep, File &gt; Export Symbol will give you an SVG. If you plan on sharing it with other designers it’s best to export the latest version (4.0) so that new features like monochrome layers + variable color are included 
Awesome. Thanks a lot for! :pray::slightly_smiling_face: 
We don't recommend editing the SVGs that come out of the <code>File &amp;gt; Export Symbol...</code>  option, however, they're just intended for data delivery. The recommended workflow is to use <code>File &amp;gt; Export Template...</code> if you want to edit the shape of the symbol, bring that template back into the SF Symbols app, do your annotation within the app, and then use <code>File &amp;gt; Export Symbol...</code> for delivery. </p>

<h4 id="is-it-possible-to-assign-colors-dynamically-to-sf-symbols-rendering-in-multicolor-mode">Is it possible to assign colors dynamically to SF Symbols rendering in multicolor mode?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Multicolor rendering mode uses the colors assigned to the symbol by the designer. Use palette mode to use a dynamic set of colors. 
There are some parts of symbols in multicolor that are still controlled by colors you specify, however. For example, <code>folder.fill.badge.plus</code> in multicolor will keep the badge's colors locked to green and white, but you still have control over the color of the folder. 
Is it possible to dynamically assign multiple colors to the symbol rendering in palette mode? 
Yes. SwiftUI allows multiple foreground styles, and AppKit &amp; UIKit allow an array of colors for palette mode 
Amazing! Thanks for answering I will do some reading on how to do it 
The API for AppKit/UIKit is <code>configurationWithPaletteColors:</code> which takes an array of colors 
And in SwiftUI what you want is the <code>.foregroundStyle</code> modifier:

</blockquote>
<p>Awesome, we have Thalia here to answer this. 
I’m sure it might take a minute to compose her many thoughts… 
I would start with looking at the symbols in the context of other symbols. For example, if you are drawing a symbol about astronomy, you would want to looks at symbols that are lated like the moon, stars, etc. 
From there, I would start by defining the proportions, not too wide, not too tall, all related to the other symbols. 
And next I'll try to match the stroke thickness, roundness of the shapes, angles. It all depends on what you are trying to draw. 
Let's say you need a telescope. Then I'll probably try to match some of the angles of other symbols. 
It's about looking at the context and iterating to get the best results. It's also good to look at the symbol in small and big sizes, to craft the best drawing possible for all scenarios. 
Matching the line weight within SF Symbols is a good metric to follow. Also, referencing the scale and alignment of SF Symbols for shapes that are similar to what you are trying to make is a good place to start. For example, if your custom symbol is circular, scale it similar to a circle in SF Symbols. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>&lt;@U03HLJY8FRA&gt;? 
But do their symbols have variable color support?! 
A big advantage is that there are so many symbols to choose from so extending the library is easy. And also the way symbols are designed to work with text (font weight matching, small and large variants). Right to left support 
As I said in the talk last year, the kind of design that requires no additional work from me is the <em>best</em> kind of design! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:</p>
<p>But really, the team has been working on SF Symbols as a way to help people make apps that look fantastic and blend seamlessly with the rest of Apple platforms. Even <em>more</em> importantly, SF Symbols are also designed with accessibility and inclusivity in mind. They react to things like Dynamic Type and Increased Contrast automatically, which is a big win for users of your app. 
Symbols offer many benefits: visual craft and integration with the system font, accessibility features including localized variants for many languages and scripts. Familiarity with users across the platforms. Smaller app footprint. </p>

<p>Hi Sean, only for software running on Apple Platforms 
SF Symbols are for Apple platforms only. 
Great thanks! :grinning: 
SF Symbols as you have seen are very dynamic. This functionality is implemented by Apple’s OSs. So besides the restriction, it isn’t practical. </p>

Anyone is welcome to answer this pressing question. 
I don’t do either so my answer is that it seems like a lot of work. LOL 
Lots of colors, lots of moving pieces, but in the end it all comes together to make something completely unified!

</blockquote>
<p>It's possible to export a new symbol using <code>File &amp;gt; Export Symbol...</code> and bring that into your app to support lower deployment targets. Remember to adjust the symbol version accordingly, though! 3.0 for last year's releases and 2.0 for the year before that. 
Note that you can still use the latest template format (4.0) with custom symbols even when deploying to earlier deployment targets as long as you are using Xcode 14 to compile your app.  Naturally, the new content features won't be present on those earlier releases, so you need to be careful about which template content features you use.  Safest of course is to just export with the older template versions as Paul recommends. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think I can answer the second part of the question only :wink: but yes, there is definitely a lot of collaboration between teams to define what are the best symbols and design that fit best in the UIs. We want to make the symbols as good as possible, so there is a lot of iterations too! 
I can’t imagine the amount of work it must take when the library is so huge and each symbol is so carefully crafted. Thanks for your answer! 
There's also an incredible amount of work that comes in from the frameworks and platform engineering sides to support all these new features like Variable Color and different rendering modes! 
For adding new symbols: it’s a combination of supporting new platform features, adopting symbols for existing features and identifying concepts that have broad utility and application across a variety of apps and contexts. 
Thanks so much for your replies, everyone! I <em>super</em> appreciate all of your hard work! :heart: </p>

<h4 id="do-variable-colors-animate-automatically-when-changed">Do variable colors animate automatically when changed?</h4>

<p>Hi &lt;@U03JBMMB10A&gt; can you elaborate a bit? 
There isn't any animation when the variable color percentage changes and causes a layer to "dim" or "un-dim." The change appears instantly. 
Okay, thank you. 
The path color will instantly change according to the corresponding percentage value. 
Using variable colors does not automatically animate across the visual states. However it is entirely possible to add animation to Symbol just as you would to other UI Images using the UI framework animation facilities of your choice. 
Right, thank y’all! </p>

<p>Great question! I think that starts coming down to the customization you'd love to do for the app. For example there's no hard and fast rule that you <em>have</em> to use SF Symbols, or Apple Typefaces or a specific aesthetic for your app (and that's even more true for games).</p>
<p>Think of the HIG as a great "base" for what you're doing, and tailor the guidance based on what makes the most sense for your users! 
&lt;@U03HJ86L1BL&gt;’s also done a great job at wording the language of the HIG so we rarely ever say "don't" or "never" unless that's really true. </p>

<p>Hey Duncan, a lot of the content in the HIG carries through from previous versions. But a lot of the older content was adjusted for clarity and we removed things that no longer seemed all that relevant. It’s hard to go through all the specifics but pretty much every page needed to be edited. 
We also started adding in new guidance for iOS 16, macOS Ventura, and watchOS 9 (though there’s still a lot more coming this summer 
One example I recall was the Buttons page. There was content in there about placard buttons and bezel buttons but those really aren’t used these days 
We also removed some of the content about full color icons in toolbars, for example, since that’s not something modern apps do all that much of. 
Another key change is in perspective: Rather than starting with guidance for an iOS experience, the revised HIG encourages designing the experience first and then adjusting it as needed to run great on each platform. 
We added a lot of new information in the Patterns section for things like Searching or Sharing. That kind of content was spread out in component pages previously and missed a lot of important information and context when it was tied to specific controls </p>

I love how much more comprehensive it is. What are best practices when designing an app that is cross platform?

</blockquote>
<p>The best approach is to follow the relevant platform conventions. Many of them exist because of how the hardware functions. So ignoring that leads to software that feels disconnected from the hardware. 
I also wonder to what extent it's applicable to the web, especially considering seeing more web apps coming from Apple! 
Apps that are designed once for all platforms will never feel right everywhere 
It does apply, there are differences in conventions between web and apps. 
Some of the difference are pretty easy to address. Like not using “Click this button” in an app that only runs on touch screen devices 
^ huge pet peeve! Also Android and iOS differ a lot in how "back" functionality works for example. So making sure that the design patterns follow system conventions helps quite a bit to not make your app feel like it's alien to the platform 
Thanks for the insight, &lt;@U03HBJXV0TY&gt; and &lt;@U03DMQBFPH8&gt;! They are really helpful. I'll definitely share them with my team who insists on having the same design across different platforms (hamburger menus and FABs everywhere!) 
Look I love a good FAB but only when I've designed for Android in the past! Thanks for the question &lt;@U03J20D4Q03&gt; hope that helps because yes, you can be 80%-90% consistent where you can but those platform details matter </p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a great question. Multiple things influence this. One is our work (in evangelism) with developers. Questions that we get during this work can often spark ideas for new areas of guidance, or new details to add to pages 
Another thing that influences the HIG is the work of our design and engineering teams, naturally. As the platforms evolve, there are needs to overhaul pages, or whole sections, to match the direction of the platform (or multiple platforms) 
+1 to what Doug said! We talk with so many designers throughout the year and for this particular redesign we reached out specifically to the community to get input on where we could improve the HIG. 
I am resisting the urge to point out the various sections that are in need of work now, although I’d like to illustrate the point I’m making by doing so </p>

<h4 id="whats-stayed-the-same-in-the-hig-over-the-past-decades">What’s stayed the same in the HIG over the past decades?</h4>

<p>Although many details have changed, I think it's the keen focus on keeping the user experience at the center of design that's at the heart of the HIG, from the earliest days to the present. 
Yes the earliest HIG (I believe from 1977???) continually emphasized the human nature of computers. How computer should conform to people and not the other way around. We are still very much firm believers of this, but with more nuance on what that means ergonomically, inclusively, as a holistic experience. </p>

<p>I haven't had time to dig in as much as I'd like to yet, but at just the bit I have it looks really fantastic! Miss seeing you folks btw, sad I wasn't able to make it out this year :slightly_smiling_face: 
That's a great question! I want to say that almost every section was rewritten to take out old, missing, or revised guidance :sweat_smile: It was a huge haul.</p>
<p>Two sections that I personally love: 
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/inclusion|Inclusion: ">https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/inclusion|Inclusion: </a>We're SO happy this page is here because it speaks not only to good design guidance but our values
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/platforms/overview|The new Platform pages: ">https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/platforms/overview|The new Platform pages: </a>These are brand spanking new and give a nice overview of "getting started with designing for [ios/mac/etc]" that also speak to how many people use these devices and the considerations you need to have. 
&gt; that were completely, or mostly rewritten
I should clarify this, I guess what I'm wondering is  if there are areas where in the rewrites the guidance has fully changed overall, rather than clarified or revised. 
The platform pages look great btw and I would imagine it's going to be super helpful for a lot of folks to have those as starting points :heart: 
Because we were working with content that ranged in age from months to more than a decade (in a few cases), I'm certain that there were places where in rewriting, we made significant changes to the guidance. But honestly, I'm not sure I can point to specific ones offhand! :face_with_monocle: </p>

For custom foreground and background colors, strive for a contrast ratio of 7:1, especially in small text."  I aim for high contrast as much as possible, but 4.5:1 is pretty limiting, and I don't think Apple always follows this rule themselves. Specifically I'm wondering about the systemColors such as systemOrange, systemMint etc, many of which have quite low contrast against white (i.e., in Light Mode). What is the intended purpose of these colours? Is it meant for text/SF Symbols? Because if so, systemMint comes in at 2.02:1 against white. Should we ever even use systemYellow? Or can we just rely on users turning on Increase Contrast if they need to? But maybe someone doesn't want to have to increase contrast for everything just so they can see that darn yellow text.  Any insight on the intended use of these systemColors would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Awesome questions Jessiah! I could take the next 45 minutes trying to answer. :slightly_smiling_face: 
In short, the rules about color contrast are a bit tricky, it’s not black and white (forgive the pun) 
Higher contrast is always better but there are mitigating circumstances that make it OK to have lower contrast. For example, text size. The larger or bolder the font, the easier it is to read given the same color value 
But a color choice that works for large type can be too low contrast for smaller text. 
The same applies for icons or glyphs (symbols): Finer features are harder to naturally harder to discern so boosting contrast is useful 
As for system colors, they don’t all work equally well in every circumstance. Orange or mint on a light background probably isn’t the best choice. Definitely not as legible as blue or purple 
Yeah I was wondering about the Notes app, it looks like some darkening is being applied to the tint colour in this case, rather than using the default system color? 
to 
I’ve worked on products where I had to incorporate colours that are notoriously difficult to have high contrast - like teal/green.</p>
<p>In those instances i’ve provided darker versions, that are perhaps not so aesthetically pleasing, but pass AA/AAA to assist visually impaired users once they enable accessible system settings. It has worked for me :heart: 
Yeah for our app which uses orange tint, we’ve used our own custom orange for light mode, and only use the sytemOrange for dark mode 
My personal guide when designing is to make all elements that need to be legible and clear have strong contrast. Details like a divider, for example, can be lighter to convey less prominence. But text should always be readable and accessible. 
I also feel like I could spend the next hour speaking about this :sweat_smile: so GREAT question. As you might know, the 4.5:1 contrast ratio comes from WCAG 2.0 guidelines. While WCAG 3.0 is still not officially "out" they have an improved way of calculating contrast that I find incredibly interesting: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#visual-contrast-of-text">https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#visual-contrast-of-text</a> 
nice I’ll take a look :thumbsup: 
I’m imagining a future accessibility feature that allows you to increase contrast per colour :stuck_out_tongue: :wink: 
or colour range 
Hahahahah, yes &lt;@U03J1EHL4KY&gt; Providing high-contrast colors in the asset catalog is a good thing. :slightly_smiling_face: We do have some technical solutions after all. And of course the system colors provide high-contrast colors for free </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well you hit on the two, sometimes opposing, forces that define ADA winners 
In my view, an ADA winner has to embody the spirit of the HIG, even if there are details that might not conform to the letter of the HIG 
But an equally important thing is the voice, or personality, of the app 
The categories that we introduced last year (2021) try to add a bit more substance and clarity around the qualities that define winning apps 
&lt;@U03H3HNAGSK&gt; Can you elaborate on the voice/personality please? 
Yeah, fair question 
I guess I just see those terms as representing two things — (1) a cohesiveness across the app — the app feels like a single experience, and is internally consistent, and (2) the app has a character or look or feel that is memorable 
Ohhh I think I gotcha, like how Carrot Weather uses satire and the robotic voice to strengthen the personality of the app’s narrator? 
Yes there's being consistent with the platform experience, and then there's taking that to the next level by differentiating your app/game as a stellar example of one of our categories. That means you don't necessarily need a visually-heavy custom branded app but you offer something by way of your design/UX that sets you apart (I'm thinking Slopes here as a great example of this) </p>

</blockquote>
<p>(These questions are good!) 
We meet with developers to ask them for feedback on existing content (qualitative). We also regularly talk with developers throughout the year about their apps and, in those conversations, common questions come up that we realize we haven’t really answered in the HIG (or videos). So those turn into ideas about how we can improve the HIG. 
And the HIG is really a massive collective effort involving design and engineering teams throughout Apple. This HIG is the product of internal experiences where people had misconceptions or questions during the design process that we anticipate designer and developers will have once we ship new features. 
Does the team do any old school, Bruce Tognazzini-style quantitative experiments when designing new features? I’m thinking of the equivalent of Fitts’s Law, but for touch. 
&lt;@U03JCS2C03Z&gt; Depends on the team! We always nerded out about that and other things (catmull rom) on the Prototyping team, but other teams keep their process more intuitive/empathy-based vs. scientific </p>

&lt;@U03J1EHL4KY&gt; Same with XD 
I'm really hoping more tools start adding the LCH (lightness, chroma, hue) color space, it makes trying to keep similar contrast across different colors much easier since it (mostly) keeps the same perceptual contrast while just adjusting the hue.

There are some cases where this type of treatment can make sense and then others where it feels like we’re just pulling over from web.  Do you have any formalized process around when to use and not use this treatment?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Good question! My sense is that links inline commonly get overlooked because (a) not expected in apps and (b) the color distinction is often too subtle. In general they should be avoided. But there are cases where it can work. One that comes to mind are “More &gt;” links at the end of a paragraph of text where you navigate to a child view to see more. Or expand a partially revealed block of text. 
But it’s almost always more clear to use a proper button or table row with a chevron. 
Probably the biggest issue with link style buttons, especially when presented in context of other text, is that the tap target size is too small (not 44pt tall) so tapping accuracy is compromised 
Thanks for the response.  Right, we’ve certainly argued from an accessibility perspective - tap targets and contrast.  The challenge is (as component devs/designers) to come up with a general alternative.  We’ve seen push back that there is an efficiency to associating an action with a verb in a sentence.  Pulling actions out to separate buttons can end up elevating them.  T&amp;C or legal section, for example. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the view I am referring to in iPadOS for Maps. 
Hi &lt;@U03JL795TE2&gt;. I think I know the component that you’re talking about … It’s the bar below the string? 
With the filter button, and the toggles? 
Hi &lt;@U03H3HNAGSK&gt;, yes thats correct. So the filter buttons. 
I had also noticed during the WWDC Keynote on Monday that the updated Home app on iOS adopts a similar component with different functionality. So my question expands to this as well. 
Ahh, I see. Toggle-able filters / buttons. Something like this may be the beginning of a pattern that is adopted across Apple apps, or these may be one-off solutions within particular apps. From a HIG POV, there is a bit of push-pull with this. If it turns into a pattern, and if that pattern is formalized as a specific element in a framework, that is typically the criteria for arrival in the HIG 
This is an interesting one, though. 
Thanks for raising it. 
Appreciate the feedback on this &lt;@U03H3HNAGSK&gt;. 
Thanks for asking, this is a fun one 
Makes me realize that, for a concrete control like this, the HIG is relatively conservative; something really needs to be a component that is defined in a framework to get guidance at this level. But for bigger picture, experiential things, the HIG is a bit more predictive? Or proactive? 
I've seen this type of control over the years in quite a few apps. Here is an example from Apple News on iOS 15 without the borders but works the same. Think most people understand how to use this control. 
Interestingly this has been changed in iOS 16 Beta 1 to a dropdown type control. 
Sorry correct screenshot. </p>

<p>Mostly we just want people to add color profiles to their images. If we could do that, it’d be a huge win. 
We don’t really have guidance specifically about EDR in the HIG. Might be some good documentation elsewhere on <a href="http://developer.apple.com|developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com|developer.apple.com</a> but I’m not familiar with it. 
Color profile tagging is critical, esp for P3!

<p>I also think it's a great area to explore! I posted this in another question but the WCAG 3.0 perspective on color contrast is fascinating and something that addresses our issues with how color contrast is calculated now 
It really is fascinating stuff. And how it's looking to take into account type size, boldness, etc. into the calculation in a much more nuanced way than just large or small type. Would be awesome to see Apple push some things like this outside of WCAG as well.

<p>Hi &lt;@U03JK302NRH&gt; - Yes, an 8-point grid is used in many circumstances. However, there are some exceptions. For example, layout margins are 16pt in compact size class but 20pt in regular…. 24pt would’ve been too much. Sticking at 16 would look too thin. 
The grid is mostly about width, not height 
IIRC, the decision about 44pt goes back further than the use of an 8pt grid for layout.

<p>Great question. It’s really not possible for ALL text to scale in some cases. Tab bars, for instance, don’t scale because text would truncate immediately which defeats the purpose. And there is an AX setting for showing the tab icon and label in a bezel on tap. 
The general approach is to make sure all text in the content area / scroll views scales. 
Awesome, thanks for the clarification Mike :thumbsup:

</blockquote>
<p>Hi &lt;@U03J20RJQ2X&gt;. Not sure whether a Slack answer will even scratch the surface of this question, but I have a couple of quick thoughts 
I share &lt;@U03J20RJQ2X&gt;'s pain, having a rich document editing experience within an iPhone interface 
(1) The person. Is this photo editing for … professionals? influences? some specific person? … I really would start here, even though it’s the obvious designery thing to say, because I think it helps shape what level of detail and density is appropriate 
It gets especially difficult when you try to cater to both, making the app easy to use while also giving advanced users more tools. But that’s for sure a good place to start, professionals are used to different kinds of UIs as well 
(2) The platform will dictate your heuristics around detail and density. Designing for Mac and iPad, I would push the density, and try to deliver sets of controls as completely as possible — i.e., i’d try to avoid submenus, and where I had them, I would try to make them “similar” or at least similarly labeled across controls </p>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s OK to have smaller button but you definitely want to have a tap area that extends to 44pts in height 
So, yes, padding can be a factor 
In general though, a physical background height of 44pt is a good idea. Even if the tap target is taller, users don’t know that. So they’ll naturally slow down to aim accurately </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Great question! Although the guidance is to use title case in components like button labels and menu items, it also comes down to stylistic choices for the text content within your app. 
100%, &lt;@U03HJ86L1BL&gt;! And when it comes to the content within your app, it — and your style guide — is going to evolve over time. As folks in this channel noted, we decided to move to sentence case in the HIG after many years. :slightly_smiling_face: The most important thing is to be consistent — if you’re going to use title case for your content headers, make sure you’re doing that everywhere in your app. If you change that style, make sure you’re adopting it across the board. And final tip: Even if you largely follow the paradigms of a guide like AP or Chicago Style, it’s super helpful to maintain a separate personal style guide for your content — that way, you have a great reference document. </p>

Are there any guidelines on when you would want to implement charting in a calendar as opposed to a tabbed interfaced that grouped by day/week/month etc.?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a great question! The Fitness app is focused on a daily activity like closing your rings. Since this is a top-level goal of the app, the calendar view makes it easy to see your successes through time. 
The Health app mirrors the same information but in a longitudinal form, where you can see larger trends. 
Yup that makes sense! I guess what I'm trying to wrap my head around is finding the medium of digest-able information and <em>too much</em> but that's the joy of design! 
Each of these approaches has its advantages. The calendar view excels at showing streaks and achievements relative to the day of the week. Conversely, the charts in Health aggregate away those daily details into larger trends. 
Yeah, it’s interesting to me that the calendar format is sort of perfect for the Activity Rings in that they can be displayed neatly in rows / columns on a calendar grid 
I would say the calendar is quick overview but the trends, such as in Health, is where the power of charts come in. </p>

<p>Hi &lt;@U03J21EKNSE&gt;! This is a really good question, and it’s not completely off topic. I would suggest that you bring it to the Swift UI lounge <a href="https://wwdc22.slack.com/archives/C03HX19UNCQ">https://wwdc22.slack.com/archives/C03HX19UNCQ</a> 
Hello Doug L! Thanks for letting me know; relief to know it’s not a bad thing to ask. If you are referring to the Swift UI Lounge happening right now, I have posted it there too. No bites yet; still holding hope! Thanks again. 
Thanks, yeah. The folks in here are more focused on the design side of things, so you’ll have better luck with the “how to” aspect of your question

<p>There was a similar question in &lt;#C03HX19UNCQ|&gt; and they called out that the views would work the same, just need to give proper widths. 
Hi Axel! Any Chart can be placed in a scroll view, but I'm guessing you are interested in the "pinned" Y axis behavior. You should be able to achieve this with a workaround, that is by ZStacking the Y axis on top of the scrolling chart. Please file a radar if this is a feature you want to get added to the API! 
Thanks &lt;@U03H3193G3H&gt;. Here is the result I want.

Will do thanks! 
But to be clear, it sounds like you’re trying to replicate the behavior of the in-workout UI for the Workouts app … Is your watch app made with SwiftUI? 
Or WatchKit? 
SwiftUI. Workouts is one example. Like selecting the currently highlighted metric (my implementation works but is not as "satifying" as the Workouts app), but also other views that might implement "pages" themselves. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi &lt;@U03J1EHL4KY&gt; great questions!</p>
<p>(1) This might depend on what behavior you're looking for. There currently isn't a pinch + zoom API built directly into Swift Charts, but you could capture a the gesture in a <code>chartOverlay</code> and respond to it accordingly by manipulating the scale / data in the chart.</p>
<p>(2) Yes! Absolutely. Using a <code>chartOverlay</code> and the provided <code>ChartProxy</code> to read the data point being tapped.</p>
<p>There are some great examples of these in the Swift Charts sample app (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/visualizing_your_app_s_data">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/visualizing_your_app_s_data</a>)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When used properly, animation can certainly enhance your chart… even when not tied to user interaction. For example, to indicate that a chart has updated, animating a point or growing a bar can be a helpful and delightful addition. 
Note that when adding animation, it’s also important to ensure they adapt as needed for a device’s “Reduce Motion” accessibility setting </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hey &lt;@U03J8GWEFU7&gt; … It would help to know a bit more about what you’re looking for related to <code>Person</code> 
Lynn mentioned that using these common options has Siri NLU benefits.  So i was curious what data was backing this.   Does <code>Person</code> referred to the customer’s Contacts?  Or something else 
Gotcha. 
Trying to find a reference for this. 
Is this section from the transcript relevant:
&gt; The App Intent framework does provide a set of common options for these open-ended requests, such as numerical values, dates, or time values. If your required parameter aligns with one of these, definitely select it. This will allow you to benefit from certain built-in dialog and visual patterns, as well as Siri’s natural language understanding as it pertains to these types of information. If not, you can use a custom entity.<br />
I am also interested if there is anything <code>Person</code> related but can’t find anything in the transcript re that being a supported common option type. 
here’s the screen grab where I noticed it 
Here’s the documentation on <code>IntentPerson</code>: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/intentperson">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/intentperson</a> 
&lt;@U03HJ5M01M0&gt; has entered the chat. 
Siri has built in, baseline NLU for many of these types. For example, for an integer, the user might say “one dozen”. Siri will parse this as 12 for you automatically 
Similarly, for IntentPerson, Siri has some baseline understanding of what is a first name, what is a last name, etc. Siri will attempt to construct an IntentPerson for you if you do an open ended value prompt for an IntentPerson type </p>

<p>Good question &lt;@U03JBMMB10A&gt; … &lt;@U03HJ506BGT&gt; is on it

So... the 20 top favorite people, or similar?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, for lists of this size and for a list of contacts, you would want to use an open-ended request, which would also allow you to use a person entity. 
Ok right, thanks. 
It wouldn’t be suitable for a dynamic parameter, because those contact names would become an array of strings, which limits the flexibility people can use to ask for them. 
Reading in the other thread about IntentPerson parameters. For an app that has access to CNContacts, is there a way (other than matching on name) to link an IntentPerson to the CNContact that presumably underlies the source of that information? 
&lt;@U03HJ5M01M0&gt; can you take this? 
right now you’ll need to match on name. Please file a feedback request! We’d like to hear about your use case and look into this more </p>

Instead it would include App Intents, and primarily be accessed via Siri with just dialogs &amp; custom snippets?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s an interesting question &lt;@U03J8GWEFU7&gt; … It’s a paradigm we’ve seen on Apple Watch with watch apps. Some watch apps are really just ways to deliver complications to the watch face, and rich notifications on the watch itself 
However, those watch apps also display the information that is delivered in the complication and notification. 
So anyway, the app matters :muscle: 
But technically yes, you can build an app that’s focused on providing App Shortcuts, but when someone taps on your app icon you’ll still have to have a viable experience that explains what it does.</p>
<p>Also, if you support dynamic parameters, your app will need to be be opened for you to update the order. 
So I could make an app that’s intended primarily as a container for Siri first App Intent interactions, and the app itself could just provide some context that explains the Siri functionality? 
You can build that, but if you want to manage your dynamic parameter and people are never opening your app (because it doesn’t have functionality in itself), you won’t be able to re-order or update your parameter values. 
Got it, that makes sense.   I’m just trying to get a mental model for what’s the <code>minimum viable app</code> to create for Siri!  This was so helpful </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Notably, App Shortcuts will need to include your app name, so that will help distinguish your phrases from standard Siri phrases. (i.e. “start a &lt;app name&gt; timer.“) 
With a particularly strong brand, you may even be able to skip the word timer. (i.e. “Start a Super Special Countdown”, assuming “Super Special Countdown is the app name) 
A note though! You wouldn’t want to use “for &lt;time value&gt;” in your invocation phrase, because there are infinite possible replies. That’s better as an open-ended request, for a Duration 
&lt;@U03HJ5M1UV8&gt; I want to check I understand this. Is the distinction here that “open-ended requests” are always by definition follow-up requests after the invocation phrase? I wasn’t clear on this till now. 
There are a few different types of follow-up requests after the invocation phrase, and open-ended requests are one of them. Others are parameter confirmation, intent confirmation, and disambiguation. 
But these are distinct from the dynamic parameter that you provide as part of your initial invocation </p>

<p>A lot of us some mix of backgrounds that don’t fit neatly into the typical design / engineering teams. 
Are there a lot of folks on the team who have a hard time identifying themselves as either designers or engineers, but actually both? 
I taught myself programming outside of school and dabbled in a number of open source projects and the like. Realized I enjoyed psychology / cognitive science to learn more about how people think and approach technology. Studied Cognitive Science, HCI, and Communication Design in school. Had some design jobs but eventually accidentally found this team where I got to use my programming skills too! 
That’s amazing, thank you for sharing Julian :slightly_smiling_face: 
That’s amazing! 
A teammate was at an HCI conference (TEI '17) in Japan that I happened to have work in. He passed on my name to the recruiter. I studied Design and HCI in school, and then I interviewed! 
That’s awesome, Marisa! 
I studied computer science, spent some time in HCI academia, and worked for a few startups before joining Apple. For me making delightful interactive things has always been a single pursuit, and the boundaries between things like “design” and “engineering” never made too much sense to me. My teammates will have different answers but when I look at candidate portfolios, I like to see inspiration from fields beyond design &amp; tech, a general sense of curiosity and playfulness… and just weird, unexpected, unique things! (even if they’re not the most polished) 
I completely agree, Guillaume. And I super appreciate you all taking the time to answer. Thank you! 
I was a fresh graduated from ECAL in Lausanne Switzerland, where I studied interaction design. A few months after that, Jeff our current Manager saw my bachelor graduation project on a blog and then reached out. It was such a suprise! I was super excited and curious to know more about the team and I end up joining in 2018. It was great that even though I had not much professional experience, the team was interested in my portfolio. When we are looking at candidate, I think we are interested about ideas and how the candidate communicates them, even if you have short resume like I did back then. 
Thank you &lt;@U03JGA79CQZ&gt;! That’s super inspiring to read! </p>

Im curious, when first designing a prototype of a new product, what would you say the ratio is of looks to functionality? Are looks secondary or are they the focus from the get go? Thanks :)</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the main thing is to think about what questions you are trying to answer by building one (or several) prototypes. Are they questions of technical feasibility, product usefulness,…? etc. Looks for the sake of looks are rarely worth spending lots of early prototyping time on, but sometimes different aesthetic directions or visual metaphors are definitely things you want to prototype! 
I’d add that the key balance to strike in prototyping is to make the least amount you need to make to still learn something. Sometimes that means things have to look very real so that you don’t distract from the part you’re trying to learn. 
Interesting, forsure functionality and user experience is so important - although I do find myself holding my AirPod Max’s and just staring at how beautiful they are more then I listen to music :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:</p>
<p>Do you guys have separate teams for functionality and then a team for looks, or is it all entwined?

<p>Finding a way to fake it! We talk about this in most of our old WWDC sessions, but Prototyping for AR (2018) has some good examples of finding clever ways to prototype that don’t involve code at all. 
There are ways to fake things with paper printouts, or with clever video capture. But often doing some simple Keynote animations can teach a lot too. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Anything that Apple has shipped and might ship is the sort of thing we prototype! :slightly_smiling_face: I personally have worked a lot on cameras (iPhone, iPad) and Pencil over the years, as well as Watch and Health related features more recently. The process of making a design is generally making something, showing it to people, and learning from their feedback, and doing it over and over again. We've given a few WWDC talks on that topic over the years! We don't really count how many "drafts" we make, but everything we work on undergoes many, many iterations. 
Are there differences between the final product hardware and software, or are the prototypes meant to test a specific feature and include some hardware and software features, but not all of it? aka. are you trying to test something with the mindset of a customer, or as a engineer? 
The mindset of a customer, or a person using the product or feature. We collaborate closely with engineering teams that figure out feasibility. Our prototypes help them understand which use cases need to be supported. </p>

<p>Definitely show it to broader teams. It's less about testing in a traditional, thorough sense, and more about getting lots of people from different backgrounds to try it and tell us what they think. 
Thanks &lt;@U03HBKARTV4&gt; :raised_hands: If I may ask a follow up question, what kind of feedback are you looking for when testing the prototype? 
We always build a prototype to answer questions, so what we're looking for will be about what that specific prototype is trying to answer. For example, when we were working on Scribble for iPad &amp; Pencil, we wanted to really understand how people reacted to their handwriting being converted to digital text, what made that process more clear/understandable, what sorts of input would lead to confusion situations, and so on.

<p>Hi Sam! Making in the medium the design is meant to be in is important! For a prototype seeking to answer an interaction design question, interactive prototypes are essential. For the design of a graphic poster, print out poster iterations. 
If the end artifact is meant to be spatial, then making in 3D is essential too 
I'd say there's an underlying principle that the medium that one makes/prototypes in is also a very intentional choice, and should be chosen to best align with the desired end artifact </p>

<p>We try to keep more than one direction open at a time. It might mean having multiple very different prototypes, or one prototype than has sliders / prefs and can be adjusted. If someone gives us good feedback, we incorporate it or try it out. If it’s in conflict with the previous direction, we keep both around to let people compare. 
That’s great - thanks Julian. It makes sense to let people interact with different prototypes and observe, if I may ask, how flexible do you make prototypes? Are people allowed to tap on anything interactive on the screen, or is it limited to one flow? 
It’s usually very limited. We make it look like everything’s there, but only certain parts will be functional. It’s important that the rest look real because it’s often in the whole context of a product that we learn the most.

It happens that something we're very excited about is not something that makes it out the door for some reason, in those cases we tend to keep bringing it up in future work that touches on that concept, and work with teams inside the company who are excited about it too to try to build momentum together. 
Very insightful thanks 
Cool </p>

<p>Alberto, you just described the founding philosophy of Meng To over at <a href="https://designcode.io/">https://designcode.io/</a> 
&lt;@U03HBKARTV4&gt;? 
Haha, the question of "should designers learn to code" is an eternal one... long answer short, I think code should be seen as one more tool in your toolbox. If you feel like it might let you make things you couldn't make otherwise, and you're drawn to it, then go for it! SwiftUI is the easiest to learn it's ever been :slightly_smiling_face: And Meng's website is great! </p>

<p>AfterEffects has been my go to (light scripting, integration with C4D, able to combine with footage, I end up doing a lot of green screening) 
Recently got excited about a library that makes Unity's interface more like a traditional-timeline-animation-style ui 
I understand and commiserate with your gripes about modern animation tools though. I have to pull up Grapher and just fiddle with my equations (when transitioning to code) 
(so happy you mentioned magic move in keynote though! Early decks where we try to cover as many ideas as possible, going for breadth, there's plenty of keynote animations for our light sketches) 
I'm a big fan of <a href="https://createwithflow.com/">https://createwithflow.com/</a> who generate code from visually-designed animations.
Supernova Studio was another doing similar things but they pivoted off to <em>design system management</em> </p>

<p>Always remember what are you building a prototype for, what are you trying to answer. We can get caught up sometimes in trying to have a very polish prototype but it should always be about quickly and efficiently testing a panel of different ideas. Sometimes it helps to just use low tech tools, quickly sketch things on paper, get away from screen. 
Thank you! 
Our team like to repeat the process of:
make things -&gt; show to people -&gt; get some feedback
and repeat until it the experience feels good! 
Sounds like a great process to follow!

<p>It’s often the opposite direction — we’re typically prototyping new products or features that in turn teach us things we could make better about existing products! 
Ah, that’s very interesting! And when prototyping new products, is that something your team decides to explore, or do you get “asked” to explore a certain thing? 
Both. We pursue things that we think might be interesting, but we’re also keeping tabs on the possibilities that interest partner teams that are asking for our help. </p>

<p>We work closely with them! With engineering teams to understand the technical capabilities and limitations that we are working with, and with design teams to understand the roadmap they have for their products, and what problems they're trying to solve right now. The time horizon we work on (3-5 years) is a bit longer than the one most teams operate on, so communication is key for us to be aligned. 
If you're able to speak about it, I'd be interested to know if either of these roles ever initiate requests from the prototyping teams, or if novel / net new experiences are normally initiated by the prototyping team

</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely! I think any creative in any field suffers from the "blank page" problem... for me I find that spending time doing things not tech/design related (playing music, spending time outdoors, reading books about random obscure topics,...) will often spark unexpected connections &amp; inspiration that somehow find their way into my work. Something a little more specific I like to do too is to dive in the history of a topic I'm working on - for example the history of human mark making &amp; handwriting through various cultures was very inspirational when I worked on Pencil. 
That’s both reassuring and inspiring to read. Thanks &lt;@U03HBKARTV4&gt;! 
"too many things to consider" is totally relatable, and absolutely something present in the day to day. I have personally really enjoyed organizing and grouping ideas along a "design space", by trying to figure out what common axis the ideas might have. It helps me feel less overwhelmed, and also allows me to identify any areas I haven't considered. 
That’s a really great idea, &lt;@U03J0DULM0V&gt;! I suppose it’s also about sometimes just going with the flow and then reviewing and adapting the work to feedback and design principles afterwards. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>We try not to be too rigid. Often we are starting with a specific problem to solve, yes. But sometimes we make things just because they seem interesting, and then figure out why and what they can help solve. It’s about giving ourselves space to figure out what feels great. 
We can fit both types of process into the cycle we describe in our WWDC sessions: Make things, Show them to people, Learn from their feedback.

Part of my day to day work is taking prototypes and being able to communicate findings to groups and teams that may not have an interest in them (yet..). If you're able to share high level insight - I'm curious how the findings from your prototypes are communicated (format, findings, risks) to external teams or even execs. To some extent the prototype itself carries this weight, but in cases where not and in person communication is infrequent - I'm curious how your team tackles this :)</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s an interesting challenge, because different people respond to different communication styles. We do have to adapt how we communicate work depending on what people are looking for. 
The nice thing about a prototype that <em>appears</em> high-fidelity is that it lessens the amount of assumptions people are making. If it <em>looks</em> like a real app, but we fake one part of the interaction, we are helping to direct feedback toward the parts that seem new. 
Thank you - that's a nice answer and an excellent point on minimizing assumptions. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think it's important to know what the biggest questions around an idea you have, because that's what you'll want to prototype first. Is it about testing the usefulness of a feature? About exploring how to best display the results from an algorithm or machine learning model? Or is it about seeing if a new gesture interaction you came up with is easy for people to understand and perform? The goal of prototypes is to answer questions before investing a lot of time into making things real (hence why it's important to keep your prototyping process light &amp; nimble). As far as coming up with ideas... ask people questions, and listen to what they have to say! 
Thank you very much! 
I really appreciate your advice. </p>

<p>I've done much more green screening with remote work. (green screening with props and suits with OBS running the effects and compositing in realtime to a virtual camera I use in webex) 
We have a lot of collaborative Keynote decks too. Even for in-hand prototypes we build we’re taking a lot more video of them that we then place in those Keynote decks. 
I'm not in a green suit day to day of course :sweat_smile:, but I was very happy the extensive setup came in use for a project in 2020-2021. I had thought to myself "never thought I'd be grateful for webex" 
I like how it gives more opportunity to make real life situation prototypes, because your setup is at home, and not in a studio where things are impersonal. 
It forces you to stay even more connected with your teammates, to make sure you share regularly about the work </p>

<p>Sketch and Figma are two popular tools for UI design and prototyping, but ultimately they're just tools - they won't give you magical results on their own. If you'd like to get better at designing UIs and you're starting from scratch I'd encourage you to focus more on things like layout, type, color, interaction patterns (the Apple HIG is a great place to get started on those topics as they specifically pertain to Apple platforms! <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/">https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/</a>) than focusing on a specific tool. </p>

<p>Never. 
If we’re not getting feedback on something, we’re just not showing it to the right people. We will eventually show it to someone who will have feedback about it (improvements or reasons why it won’t work!)

Fake it until you make it 
&lt;@U03DMQBFPH8&gt; I’m getting a WWDC tattoo in July! I’ll get that phrase added for the prototyping team :laughing:<br />
&gt;  show them to people
This piece is so, so important. It almost immediately pays off by helping break down assumptions and normalities established by devs and designers, and lets you see your project and tools from a new perspective. Being open and receptive to that feedback is an incredibly value experience :heart: 
Considering an interaction "Before, During, and After" (i.e. in the example of a button before people press a button, how do they know they can do it, and what it will do, during the press how do they know the action is registered and whether they need to continue pressing ( any visuals that encourage continued action would be 'feed-forward'). And afterwards, what is the feedback that ensures we know how the action went?) Julian;s 2018 WWDC talk covers this in more detail 
Always bring positive feedback when sharing the work. It should never be about personal judgement but how to make your app experience better.
For example:
"I don't like this color" vs "I think blue instead of read would better communicate what the experience is about" 
"Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context – a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan." is a quote that I think also nicely captures the spirit of always being able to step back and not design something in isolation

<p>Different people on the team have different preferences. But we all attend a weekly design review with the whole Prototyping team in which all our work is shared. 
It helps us build a joint understanding of what a project is, even if it’s mostly one individual “doing the work”, we’re all helping with feedback, new ideas, and critique. The team’s brain makes the work better. 
Some folks on the team prefer being in collaborative documents 100% of the time. Others will just bring their individual work to design review. </p>

<p>Yes, but usually not because of too many new ideas! If there are too many new ideas it means we have a lot we can try out. 
Yes absolutely. When that happens we typically try to focus on what it was that people loved the most in that set of work. If you have dozens of things competing for your attention, focusing on the 2-3 that really seem to be winning hearts over is often a good way to move forward without getting bogged down. But sometimes you also have to accept that while you may have a bunch of kind of cool things, there's nothing in there that's a true winner. And that's okay! There's always way for those things you liked but which weren't clear winners to make their way into other work in the future.

Yes, as Julian said we have weekly team meetings and design reviews where we share very openly what we're working on. Those have happened every week as long as the team's been around, over 15 years now. I think being a small tight knit team is essential to our success. 
And in those design reviews we’re very open (and excited) to see random things people made that aren’t directly related to current/ongoing projects. 
This is so awesome and inspiring! Thanks so much for sharing! 
How do you scale a weekly meeting as the team / scope grows? 
We'll have smaller, more focused meetings for individual projects. The goal for the team meetings is for the whole team to see what's going on that week, but they're not exhaustive. Our team has never been bigger than ~12 people, which I think is a feature. 
I with you on keeping things small… let’s just say that’s a rarity in my experience :unicorn_face: </p>

<p>Ah.

</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of prototypes is to help advance the conversation. Instead of going in circles verbally about what might be, we start to talk about what’s in front of us. Or what could be in front of us that we haven’t made yet! 
Which is to say, we often find the things we think are interesting change dramatically once we have a few prototypes in front of us. And we have conversations about that! </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes they are definitely 2 different things, although for us they overlap a lot! I think prototyping in general refers to building artefacts quickly to answer questions that will then inform how to build something "for real". So Apple also has silicon prototypers working on the M series chips, for instance! For us, we prototype interactions and user interfaces, which means we try to explore what new modes of input or new capabilities (think for example something like FaceID/Depth Camera, or Apple Pencil) would bring to our products, which then informs whether the company should invest the resources in actually building that hardware/product. 
It depends on what the prototype is trying to answer and at what stage of the project we are. But generally a polished UI would help better communicate with other teams, make it look real. 
Yes to add to Mylène’s answer, we often have to design user interfaces <em>as a part of</em> prototyping something! 
Thanks for the answers! So sometimes it involves building a UI, but much more and not just limited to a digital UI with prototyping. 
Though sometimes we can get away with re-using large parts of the existing designs. 
I’m not sure we’re necessarily doing <em>more</em> — the final user interface designs require a lot of work to be designed for all the different devices, screen sizes, edge cases, accessibility cases, error cases… we’re fortunate to get to pass on that until it becomes a specific issue for our concept. We build on what’s already there for those parts. 
Thanks for the clarity! </p>

<p>Yes! And yes! The “tools” are a lot rougher than you might have in mind, but we’re often cobbling together our own sets of code to be able to try things. We don’t build it out into a generic reusable tool as much as we build the frameworks / scaffolding necessary to try out the very-specific thing we want to get into our hands. 
We build what’s necessary to try the specific things we want to try. We try really hard to stay away from prematurely abstracting. It’s too easy to accidentally become a framework engineer or tools engineer when we really were just trying to try something out. </p>

<p>What is your audience? We often just use “people” but if you can be more specific, like “family member” or “subscriber” that’s a good way to go. 
Think about what people using your app would call themselves. 
We try to avoid the word “users” when we refer the people who use our apps, and prefer something that sounds more human, like "artists",  "collaborators", "participants", etc. depending on the app and what people are trying to do. :slightly_smiling_face:

</blockquote>
<p>The <em>voice</em> of your app is something you want to remain consistent, so that folks get consistent messaging inside your app. But, as you point out, the <em>tone</em> can certainly modulate. When you welcome somebody, you might sound excited. But when that person has a credit card declined, you may want to sound more serious. 
Similar to how your voice is always you, but your tone changes depending on context and who you're talking to. 
In other words (no pun intended, hiyooo!), it's very common — if not important — to adjust your tone throughout your app. The tone should reflect the situation. 
As an example, coaching from the Activity app on Apple Watch is celebratory when you close a ring. But it's more matter-of-fact if your progress is lacking. 
Right, there is a clear distinction between voice and tone, thanks for answering both of you! And I loved your pun &lt;@U03HJ5LRUEN&gt; :joy: 
Hmmm - I guess I’m still struggling with tone vs voice - Carrot weather has insults woven into weather forecasts. Is that voice? Maybe it doesn’t have a tone. I’ve never bought it because I didn’t like whatever it was 
I don't think these rules apply to Carrot Weather App :joy: </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Great question. One way to think about it, is that your product is a major part of your brand.</p>
<p>With that in mind, your product may have more specific guidelines to follow so that you can make your interface feel familiar — and subsequently, intuitive. These kinds of patterns are outlined in the the Human Interface Guidelines.</p>
<p>Your brand, however, may encompass more than just what appears in your product. Your website, emails, marketing collaterals, events, and even the App Store descriptions mentioned earlier, these are all examples of surfaces where your voice extends beyond your app. For us, that's where the Apple Style Guide kicks in, helping us to adhere to a wider set of grammar and syntax to ensure we have consistency at every customer touchpoint.</p>
<p>Think about this balance for your app, too. How can your app have clarity and consistency throughout, and how can that narrative continue outside of your app to complement what you — and your users — are trying to do?

<p>This is such a good question &lt;@U03HVE4TV8E&gt; 
I don't think there's a single answer to it, but &lt;@U03HVEWEGAF&gt; &lt;@U03HWQ6F9A5&gt; and &lt;@U03HJ5LRUEN&gt; have some thoughts 
It's going to vary based on the complexity of your app or how simple its premise is. We find what often helps is to incorporate onboarding elements or moments into the first-time experience for someone new. 
Also great question :fire: 
Maybe I'm saying the same thing, but the best onboarding doesn't feel like "onboarding" 
Thanks for answering :D so, I have an app that tracks deliveries, so should the be super simple along the lines of “Track your deliveries” in large title text, maybe a little but of information, and then “Get started”? All in one view. Thanks :pray:<br />
There’s no one answer to this! My favorite onboarding experiences are the ones you do right within the app itself. Like those early levels of a game that teach you how to play it. Or a chat app that uses the chat to get you set up. 
Alto's Adventure! 
You're just dropped into the game, and you're playing, and it's teaching you along the way 
&lt;@U03H3HNAGSK&gt; Ahh, I love that game! And yeah, the onboarding is really nice and seamless!

<p>Great question! I’ve been wondering this myself recently :facepunch: 
Totally great question. we get it a lot. We have an answer for you in the HIG: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/presentation/sheets">https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/presentation/sheets</a> 
Position Done and Cancel buttons as people expect. Typically, a Done or Dismiss button belongs in a sheet’s top-right corner (in a left-to-right layout) or top-left corner (in a right-to-left layout). The Cancel button belongs in a sheet’s top-left (in a left-to-right layout) or top-right (in a right-to-left layout) corner. 
Good question &lt;@U03JRQUJ27J&gt;. This has been an interaction pattern in recent releases, moving away from the elevated sheet and toward the full-screen presentation with the close in the top right 
Omg I LOVE that this is in the HIG now!! I literally have sent in at least 100 bug reports pointing out where the Cancel button is incorrectly located at the right. I have like 100 screenshots collected I attach to each bug report showing places where Cancel is correctly located at the left. :heart: 
It is interesting however there seems to be a bit of conflict with close buttons moving to the right recently (Safari, sheets with X instead of Cancel) :thinking_face: </p>

<p>This goes back to context. If that feature is relevant or helpful at that moment, then yes, go ahead and talk about the new feature. But if it’s not relevant to that moment, think about where else it would feel more contextual.

Are there examples that come to mind where the UI was the opposite, too terse and needed more explanation?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>There are may examples of this, I'm sure. One that comes to mind is when people input personal information, like when ordering something for delivery to their home. Sure, you could just indicate that you received the information, but by restating what you received (so the customer can ensure it was entered correctly) and maybe even stating that the info won't be used for nefarious purposes (eg. it wont be sold to advertisers), you create a level of comfort that more economical language might not afford. 
Think about when you tell a server at a restaurant that you want a certain dish, but with extra pickles and hot sauce but no tomatoes and can you please switch the fries for a salad. Some servers won't write that down. And while that's impressive to see, it's also nice to hear when the server repeats it back to you so you know the meal will come as you asked. 
Love that metaphor &lt;@U03HJ5LRUEN&gt;. Another thing we do often is link out to support articles for people who want to learn more about a particular subject. That way the information is there if you need, but it's not in the way. </p>

<p>In our session, we talked about information hierarchy. As with everything it’s going to depend on the specifics, but in general, think about your headlines and buttons. Make them clear and aligned with each other. 
Keep other text brief and easy to read. Rather than a big block of text, can you break it up into bullet points or even multiple screens?

<p>Good question &lt;@U03K1B3MQL8&gt; ... You don't need to remove it, if you've got it. But on iOS 16 forward, you can begin to move away from it by creating and supplying App Shortcuts, rather than requiring people to set them up

</blockquote>
<p>Ooh good question. It really depends on your audience - are they professional photographers? Then they might understand more technical terms. You can also help define things with secondary text. 
Thanks for the reply! The app is not targeted at professionals, so I’ve tried to find ways to better communicate what those tools do 
If these are terms of art, and it sounds like they are, it can be best to stick with them. Avoid jargon, or making up terms that might end up confusing everyone. That said, if your audience is less technical, maybe define the terms so people can learn them. 
+1 to what &lt;@U03HWQ6F9A5&gt; and &lt;@U03HVEWEGAF&gt; said here. We aim to democratize access to technology with much of our hardware, software, and services at Apple; so we aim to have our language be understood by as many people as possible. But with a few of our apps, we have a specific audience (eg our creator tools, like Apple Music for Artists, that focus on specific audiences), and therefore we want the language to be in the vernacular of the users—otherwise it may feel like we've shipped a watered-down professional feature. 
Since it's not aimed at professionals, show it to friends (or strangers) and see if they understand what's written. And as Jen and Kaely pointed out in their talk, consider reading it out loud to yourself as well. 
Thanks a lot the replies! One area of iOS that just came to mind was the blur intensity adjustment in Portrait Mode. Even though it’s a feature that’s not necessarily aimed at pros, it’s using f-stops as an analogy to real life photography. </p>

<p>Hi &lt;@U03HMCT187R&gt; good question. The HIG is a living document, so it’s always getting updated in big and small ways. Between now and the fall, the updates will (most likely) be small. In the fall, the bigger updates will land. 
Another way of answering your question is: You might as well get started with that read-through! It has been great to get feedback on the redesign, so don’t be shy about that, either 
I think it would be great if it was clearer when there's more minor updates, like a technologies page gets added or something. Sometimes I'll discover on Twitter, but a more central diff would be nice! I can file feedback about this too. 
We're already planning for changelogs in the HIG coming some time this summer! </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for remembering that session. It was YEARS ago. 
We have a few, mostly they center on design conventions that come over from other platforms that could be adapted to match Apple platform conventions 
For example, drawing a back button as an arrow (with a tail) instead of a chevron ( &lt; ) 
^ that's an android thing 
Tab bars that have a button in the center that performs an action rather than navigating to a location in the app 
One that comes to mind that might've been mentioned in that session is avoiding the standard Apple platform icon for share sheet button. 
Both so common :pensive: 
Yep! 
That one gets my blood boiling. :slightly_smiling_face: 
My current pet peeve is floating buttons (i.e. on Twitter). Like, a plus in the corner that is just floating there :joy: 
What's the icon they use, like three dots or something? 
Also, kabob menus (three vertical stacked dots) instead of an ellipses symbol 
For me I personally dislike icons without labels. Unless you think your icon is universally understandable across all cultures – because it usually isn't :stuck_out_tongue: 
This thread really stirred the pot with food-related anti-patterns. 
Another one I just thought of: close buttons on the right instead of the left? 
That’s the one that always gets me. Where does one place close buttons? </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hey &lt;@U03K1SMSPUZ&gt;, great question. This is highly dependent of the context and content of the app. Be cautious of cards that display unrelated or disparate types of information and make an interface feel like a dashboard. Dashboards are similar to Home tabs, as the information is not directly related and often overloaded. This makes it difficult to glance and takes longer to understand the relationships and how to take action 
So, if you use cards or have a dashboard like view, try to keep the content relevant to the current tab? 
We’ve seen some apps that have a wide array of Widgets that can be configured like a dashboard. It can be very powerful, especially on iPad. But these widgets would take you to the corresponding tab in the app. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Curious about if there are situations when the tab bar should be hidden also. 
It’s true that News doesn’t follow the typical convention we recommend for tabbed apps. I can’t really speak for the News team, but I believe the thinking was that people don’t generally switch between tabs frequently or want to persist state in each tab since the content changes all the time 
People drill into articles, read, and then often leave. 
You could consider temporarily hide the Navigation Bar for immersive experiences, just be sure to allow
the reverse interaction and show it when swiping down or tapping the screen. 
In that usage pattern, persisting the tab bar to allow for fast lateral navigation, or keeping it visible to help people stay oriented, is less of an imperative. 
This is pretty atypical for tabbed apps though 
got it! Yes I was thinking it can be also be possible to use a modal instead of a push with hidden nav bar </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I believe you’re referring to the ellipses SF Symbol in the navigation bar? 
We would use this button for secondary actions that are related to the view, but perhaps not the primary actions someone would take 
"..." More menus are typically used to host a set of additional actions vs. navigation. You'll often see designs conflate the two. 
If an app must use more than 5 tabs, is an ellipsis the appropriate icon for the “More” tab?

<p>They’re a relative recent change to iOS (last year I think). It’s a matter of taste and judgement I think. But they’re particularly effective when the list is text only. It helps created needed differentiation (or grouping) between content items and category labels 
If the list items are visually distinctive, larger section headers might not be needed. But, personally, I think they’re an improvement in all situations. </p>

But the argument that's often given in its favour is that people understand it because that's how the first page is often referred to in web and app design and changing it would mean forcing people to change their already established habits.  Would Spotify / Twitter doing away with the home tab be a risky UI move that could lose them followers or a much needed navigation cleanse?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>We can’t speak about what other companies should do, but I don’t consider risky moving to a more intuitive labeling convention, this way you ensure predictability and intention. 
Specificity is always a good thing. If there’s a more descriptive word to use, it should be used. 
I was just thinking that. Maybe instead of “Home” it should just be “Timeline” for Twitter 
And even web is starting to move away from the "home" concept. I have a feeling it will end up in the same category as having a floppy disk represent "save" </p>

<p>Hmm. Can you elaborate what example you’re referring to? 
None of these examples share UI that isn’t yet released :blush: 
Navigation bar appearances? <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationbar/3198027-scrolledgeappearance">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationbar/3198027-scrolledgeappearance</a> 
Yeah of course! If you notice how the image goes behind an invisible NavigationBar but the toolbar is still visible 
That’s a standard navigation bar with the background blur removed 
The image goes behind the navigation bar and it’s optional to remove its background, but for TAB BARS it’s not recommended. 
Yes, the background translucency should not be changed or removed on the tab bar. On a navigation bar, it can be an aesthetic choice if it doesn’t hinder the user experience </p>

<p>Funnily enough we were just talking about this here: <a href="https://wwdc22.slack.com/archives/C03H77GM1NW/p1654814044982489">https://wwdc22.slack.com/archives/C03H77GM1NW/p1654814044982489</a> 
“Kebab menu”? Is that a thing? now I’m hungry… 
Most of these components are problematic for other reasons. For example, FABS tend to cover elements of an interface which can be difficult to read or interact with the content behind the action. They also tend to be duplicated across tabs and the redundancy, shows that the action lacks context 
And yes to all of the above, a lot of those paradigms you'll see on Android and it instantly makes people feel as if the design wasn't intended for an Apple platform. 
Yes to above! I should add that FABs aren’t verboten on iOS but the action should be VERY important and VERY frequently used. Otherwise they get in the way. Things and Notes are two good examples of where a FAB makes sense. Problem is a lot of other apps use FABs for an action that isn’t all that common. 
After years of freelancing and working in startups, the most annoying thing was UI/UX concepts fighting against the (native) platform language - for the sake of brand experience, for “streamlining and build it faster” (the opposite was true) or lack of knowledge (or empowerment) of the designers. It is really hard to find good mobile1st designers…. still after over 10yrs 
We feel your pain. 
btw: I consider SwiftUI more a design than a code challenge… (for the same reasons) 
Agree Oliver. I'm not a designer but I've certainly tried to advocate for native look and feel when working with designers on iOS apps, &lt;@U03HBJXV0TY&gt;'s session Essential Design Principles from WWDC 2017 helped clarify my thinking around this. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi &lt;@U03JRQAFUKA&gt;, could you share what a feature tab would consist of? 
I guess maybe recommended articles for example? 
Hard to say a blanket "yes or no" because it depends on the content inside the tab. We do "For You" tabs where the content inside changes dynamically based on what we think is relevant to the user. That could be considered a "featured" section but its use case is specific enough from navigation that it can be its own page 
Where it gets iffy is when you're just repeating the same content as in your navigation put on a page. That causes confusion with whether people should use the tab bar or Featured page to access information 
Recommended &amp; feature articles could be highlighted under the Articles tab, instead of having a dedicated tab. I’d say, as &lt;@U03DMQBFPH8&gt;, that it would be case by case and depending of the level of personalization the app offers. 
Ah okay, that makes sense! Thank you! </p>

<p>We have progress indicators on iOS currently
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/status/progress-indicators">https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/status/progress-indicators</a> 
We don't currently have published design guidance on that particular style of progress indicator (when it becomes more common the platform we'll consider). 
Gotcha! Thanks for your answers, &lt;@U03HBHWCB4N&gt; and &lt;@U03DMQBFPH8&gt;. I really enjoy reading through the conversations going on here. 
Although from prior experience I can say that what that toasts are tricky to work with. The one you're seeing in iOS 16 is nice because it's using a deliberate "x" close button so people can dismiss the UI and it knows the process takes long enough that the toast won't magically disappear in 1 sec making it impossible to read or interact with 
So it's not disappearing automatically after the batch edit has completed? I need to try it myself, I guess… 
It is disappearing automatically after the batch edit completes, but the reason it appears in the first place is that batch edits take time so it's appropriate for this context </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Great question, &lt;@U03J1TN6WBD&gt;. This is a judgement call based off of the importance of the profile. In many cases, the profile is not that important to the apps main functionality and it isn’t needed as a tab bar item. 
When considering what should be a tab, think of your apps menu of options. When tabs are designed well, they tell a story at a glance about what your app can do and how people can use it. Profile tends to be less important in the scheme of things. 
And just because you have tabs to use, doesn’t mean you have to use them all. Sometimes an app will feel more approachable if the tabbed navigation is simplified 
Agree with &lt;@U03HBHWCB4N&gt;. Also, if the user needs to access the Profile content regularly and you don’t want to place a profile button in the nav bar of every tab, a profile tab may be a better option. 
Side note I wish the Updates tab were restored in App Store, I check for app updates multiple times a day and read the release notes. Def inefficient to open the profile screen. (Yes I might have a problem :laughing:) </p>

</blockquote>
<p>&lt;@U03JRNE4KJL&gt; I totally understand how this could be confusing. You’re right, top right accessories are used for the main actions. But in the case of Modals there might be other resources more suitable - like buttons - to convey important actions. So Close takes the top right place.
I’d say that prioritization of the actions on screen are key here, once you have a clear understanding - you could decide what’s the best pattern to follow.

</blockquote>
<p>I love this question. I wish I had the time to answer more thoroughly. Here are some thoughts about tab bars and navigation bars: these components and interaction patterns clearly resonated with people. Maybe that was luck, maybe it’s a pattern that reflected our natural understanding of how things are organized and arranged already in the world around us. But they have evolved and modernized while staying true to what ‘just worked’ originally. As people’s comfort with apps grow, new patterns emerge to support new complexity such as sidebar being a solution specific to a new device and form factor </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since swipe actions are more for power users, we always recommend that they are <em>also</em> exposed in the detail view. For example, if there’s a delete action on your table cell, make sure there’s a delete action in a toolbar, navigation bar or in-line within the secondary view. </p>
