    Hello again! I had asked earlier about the dark backgrounds used in the workout maps, and the possibility to choose a light background (easier to read!). The change happened after Dark Mode was introduced, and users don’t have options to go light/dark; just dark/satellite view. I asked the same question in the Maps lounge area, and Maryna S (Apple) thought it would be best suited for this discussion area. Still hoping someone in this area will be able to suggest a path forward! Have a good day/weekend.

<p>Yes, the only way to do this is to save a workout route with one location. And that's what we'd recommend.
Could you file a feedback request to expose the location data that the Workout app is saving?</p>
<p>FB9724128 filed 26 Oct 2021</p>
<p>A simple API (or WorkoutBuilder) doing this would be awesome. Implementing this ourselves in Apps is a pain.</p>
<p>So you're requesting something simpler than WorkoutRoute?</p>
<p>Yes. Single location. Try comparing a Run workout recorded with Workout vs a Tennis activity for example.</p>

<p>You can use WeatherKit to get the information and populate the appropriate keys on <code>HKWorkout</code> metadata</p>

<p>That’s not possible. To pass data from your iOS to your watchOS app you can use the Watch Connectivity framework: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchconnectivity">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchconnectivity</a></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Ideally we would like to import the adherence log into a provider-facing SMART-on-FHIR dashboard within Epic, so it can be used clinically and to inform clinical decision support algorithms. Will file a Feedback request!</p>
<p>&lt;@U03KJQYL37A&gt; thanks for asking this! We had the exact same question. Is it worthwhile to file another feedback? Does that help communicate demand/interest for this API?</p>
<p>&lt;@U03JETJ7UU9&gt; do you have a similar use case?</p>
<p>To be clear is Health Record Medication data the medicationRecord data coming from FHIR records? In other words,</p>
<p>HealthKit wouldn't allow us to even read the list of medications (rather than the adherence data specifically)</p>
<p>@Jeffrey we are able to read the medication list from HealthKit</p>
<p>&gt; is Health Record Medication data the medicationRecord data coming from FHIR records?
That is correct.</p>
<p>One thing I'm curious about is whether Medications will read that list? Or it will only contain medications that patients manually input?</p>
<p>The medication list imported from a FHIR API is often incorrect if a proper reconciliation is not done, so it could be problematic if patients are asked to take medications they are not currently on.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03JETJ7UU9&gt; feel free to also file your enhancement request, always helpful to know the quantity of interest</p>
<p>Hey &lt;@U03HLLFBYUD&gt;! I spoke with you on Monday at Apple Park. Thanks again!</p>
<p>&lt;@U03KJQYL37A&gt; not the exact same use case. Our company helps users afford prescription medication at the pharmacy. Understanding adherence is hugely helpful in assisting a user in that aspect of their health care journey</p>
<p>&lt;@U03KJQYL37A&gt; here are the details about the Health Records API: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/706/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/706/</a>
This API does not include medications the user is adding manually in iOS 16</p>
<p>Thanks &lt;@U03HLLFBYUD&gt;! Was curious if the medications from the Health Records API can be synchronized with the Medications part of the Health app in iOS 16? Or are they completely separate?</p>
<p>In other words, if we update the medication list in the electronic health record, and the patient imports that list, will they then be able to track adherence? Or will they need to manually input those new medications?</p>
<p>I just submitted FB10112326 on this topic :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>&lt;@U03KJQYL37A&gt; best if you try it out on the developer beta, you can even use Simulator and the sample Health Records accounts that have some FHIR medication data. Always happy to receive feedback, please file it and we’ll aggregate.</p>
<p>Thanks, I submitted FB10112456</p>
<p>I can definitely see why you’d want to keep them separate. One is a (hopefully) correct &amp; reconciled medication list from the provider, one is what the patient/user entered.
Would be good to have a way to take it over into the user-maintained list though &amp; then report adherence for that.</p>
<p>I think I’ll file a report for that tooo :thinking_face:</p>
<p>&lt;@U03JRQHF7T2&gt; that's what I was hoping to have as well!</p>

<p>Unfortunately there’s currently no way to do this. :disappointed:  You can use the <code>limit:</code> argument on queries to avoid loading too many workouts at once, but that isn’t the same as providing a count.

<p>I have one. I show the amount of workouts as a badge for a tab layout. Once I switch my app to pagination this feature would break.</p>
<p>Hey &lt;@U03HJ8YPPDY&gt; &amp; &lt;@U03J27DKK97&gt;
I'm having an app that let's browse through all your workouts. To avoid loading too many workouts I'm showing a "Load more..." Button.
If all workouts have been loaded I just want to hide to button :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>Probably lots of other use cases in showing statistics to users.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That is not currently possible, but this is an interesting question. If you had this info how would that help you? What would you do?</p>
<p>i'm wondering if users would be more into using certain apps if they're consistent with the apple workout app's calorie algorithms. most people who use strava don't like using the strava watch app, they usually use the apple workout app.
and i know each calculation is different right depending on who runs it?
what if you wanted to make an app that enhanced the display of your workouts and knew that apple users all prefer the applewatch workout app and weren't so concerned with making artisinal calories calculation workout apps? just curious</p>
<p>Interesting! Thanks for sharing, I hadn’t considered that.  We’d love a FB for that</p>
<p><a href="http://feedbackassistant.apple.com">http://feedbackassistant.apple.com</a></p>
<p>If an app adopts Workout Builder API on watchOS, it will be able to take advantage of Apple’s calorie counting algorithm, and it will be consistent with the Workout app.</p>

<p>There is no way to add power as metadata in the same way that GymKit does. However, you can save samples of the new type HKQuantityTypeIdentifierRunningPower and add them to your workout. The final workout will be saved with statistics for that type.</p>
<p>Thanks &lt;@U03HUHRGN4U&gt; , that’s very interesting!
Is there anything related for other cardio activities (such as cycling or rowing)?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Great question; there are a lot of factors that can delay query results.  Do you mind elaborating on your question a little bit?</p>
<p>Some details that might matter -
• Is there a difference in delay in the <code>HKAnchoredObjectQuery</code> results seen on the same device? Have both these apps been launched during this delay, or were they launched before the workout was recorded?
• Is the workout being recorded on the same device as is running the query? Or e.g. is one a phone and the other a watch?
• What is the frequency with with these apps are launched? Are you seeing a delay in the <code>resultsHandler</code> or the <code>updateHandler</code> ?
• When you say that the both execute hours after the workout, which device are you seeing this delay on and where was the workout saved?</p>
<p>&gt; • Is there a difference in delay in the <code>HKAnchoredObjectQuery</code> results seen on the same device? Have both these apps been launched during this delay, or were they launched before the workout was recorded?
I'd say my app has been launched more frequently / later than the app whose anchor fires first. I don't know if it matters, my app queries only workouts from my app for a specific workout type, the other queries all apps and all workout types.</p>
<p>&gt; • Is the workout being recorded on the same device as is running the query? Or e.g. is one a phone and the other a watch?
Different devices. The use case is showing a notification when the workout is done to reengage on the phone.</p>
<p>&gt; • What is the frequency with with these apps are launched? Are you seeing a delay in the <code>resultsHandler</code> or the <code>updateHandler</code> ?
My app is launched frequently, the other is not.</p>
<p>The code looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>let anchoredQuery = HKAnchoredObjectQuery(
            type: sampleType,
            predicate: compound,
            anchor: anchor,
            limit: HKObjectQueryNoLimit
        ) { [weak self] query, newSamples, deletedSamples, newAnchor, error in
            // show notification here based on arguments
            completionHandler()
        }
healthKitStore.execute(anchoredQuery)
</code></pre>
<p>&gt; • When you say that the both execute hours after the workout, which device are you seeing this delay on and where was the workout saved?
Saved on watch, query on iPhone</p>
<p>There could be different factors that could be resulting in the delay you see here.
1. If either of the devices are locked, that would delay the sync and availability of the health data between a paired watch and phone.
2. The other app may not be using HealthKit queries to receive their notification - any chance they are using the Watch Connectivity framework?
3. The HKAnchoredObjectQuery could be fired for other apps, but the results might still not include the workouts that your app is querying.</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer. How the other app is built, I don't know.</p>
<p>I am using both <code>workoutPredicate</code> and <code>sourcePredicate</code>  so I should only be receiving my workouts from my app. I believe both use HKAnchoredObjectQuery since sometimes the notifications appear at the same time.</p>

<h4 id="is-there-a-way-to-recordget-the-altitude-the-workout-in-healthkit">Is there a way to record/get the altitude the workout in HealthKit?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use the <code>CMAltimeter</code> API to get altitude data from the altimeter sensor, or alternatively use the Core Location framework to get the user’s location and read the <code>altitude</code> property of a <code>CLLocation</code> object. After getting the altitude using one of these methods, you can save it to a workout as metadata.</p>
<p>Is there a standard metadata key to ensure interoperability between apps?</p>
<p>There isn’t, but I think it’s a great idea, and I’d encourage you to file an enhancement request via Feedback Assistant (<a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/">https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/</a>). If possible, please describe both your technical requirements and a description of your use case so we can better serve your needs.</p>
<p>This is more of a general request. HealthKit is all about interoperability, but it breaks when developers choose their own keys as Strings. This is what I call Stringly Typed.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03KJSLF04Q&gt; &lt;@U03J22YQMK4&gt; bug reports for a convention/rule/dictionary for “standard metadata key” naming in general would be welcome.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It could happen in the same or different update handler. But you should be able to see the deletion and insertion. Please test on iOS 16 Beta 1 and In case you're not seeing it, could you file a Feedback?</p>
<p>I am referring to the existing iOS version. I noticed that the deletion and insertion don't happen in the same update handler, worse they can happen in any order. If you want to mirror Apple Health, I don't understand how you can do it. The update of a workout using the sync identifier is supposed to be atomic, would it be possible that you guarantee that the delete and update happen in the same update handler ? Or provide guidance how to mirror the list of workouts in Apple Health?</p>
<p>When you observe the deletion, are you using the <code>UUID</code> of the delete sample to identify the <code>HKWorkout</code> that was deleted? The <code>UUID</code> identifies the specific copy of the workout that was deleted, so that should help you keep the data in sync correctly regardless of the order that the events are delivered in</p>
<p>How do you make the difference between a normal delete of a workout with a sync identifier and a delete because of an update ?</p>
<p>There is not a way to tell the difference when observing <code>HKAnchoredObjectQuery</code> results aside from seeing both events in the same update. Is the problem you're trying to solve that when the new and deleted sample are delivered separately that it causes a momentary disappearance of the workout from the list?</p>
<p>How do you manage the case where the insert is delivered before the delete?  </p>
<p>In the case where the insert is delivered before the delete, you would inspect the metadata of the inserted sample and see that the sync identifier of the inserted sample matches the sync identifier of a sample you're already tracking and replace the one you're tracking</p>
<p>So, to put it all together I would recommend the following when processing the adds and deletes:
• When you see a deletion, check if the sync identifier <em>and</em> the UUID match a sample you're already tracking. If they do, stop tracking the copy you have.
• When you see an insertion, check if the sync identifier matches a sample you're already tracking. If it does, replace the copy you're tracking with the new copy.
If you do both of these, you should be able to reliably track changes regardless of the order they are delivered in</p>
<p>Thanks Allan</p>

<p>There is not currently an API to retrieve sources in priority order for a given data type, but it's a great request. We'd appreciate it if you filed a feedback request describing your use case!</p>
<p>In the meantime, maybe we can provide some alternative ideas. What would you do with the order?</p>
<p>Thanks! I'll file a feedback and update shortly. I’m interested in being able to respect the same priority order that HealthKit does when working with overlapping samples.</p>
<p>That makes sense. Is your goal to compute something that can't be computed by <code>HKStatisticsQuery</code>? We'd definitely like to know more about that since aggregations implemented in the framework will be more efficient than working with collections of full samples</p>
<p>I think so. I just submitted FB10113910, will try to update with some notes on use cases.</p>

I experienced frequent cases in which HK gets “confused” by the second request and doesn’t include runningWalkingDistance amongst the requested HKObjectTypes.  Is this a supported scenario?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>This should be a supported use case but it looks like you may be running into a bug. Could you file a Feedback?
In the meantime, if you request both read/share authorization runningWalkingDistance in the second call, does that help resolve the issues?</p>
<p>I tried but I run into different results with different devices (all with the same OS version). The most frequent outcome is that the RWD is not included in the request list.
Another (less frequent) outcome is that only that object type gets continuously requested for read/write in loop depending by the feature that calls requestAuthorization</p>
<p>I should probably add that one feature is specific to my iOS app, the second feature is provided by its companion watch app (and thus requests to HKStore can be isssued on different devices)</p>
<p>I had a nice Health lab yesterday with &lt;@U03HUHRGN4U&gt; who suggested me to file a report about this issue and forward it to him. Here it is: <code>FB10158579</code>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s true you can’t tell the original unit from an HKQuantity, you can just get the value for the specified unit. Best option I can suggest is to get the value in both yards and meters and heuristically use the one that is an integral number.</p>
<p>I presume you’re fine displaying pool length in different units based on the workout and not using the same unit consistently for all workouts</p>
<p>Yes this is exactly what I do! You forgot to mention the special case of a pool length of 33m1/3 as we have in Europe. So this is just a nasty hack. Would it be possible to fix this issue ? In addition third party apps can enter any number….</p>
<p>33 1/3. Nice! I think a Feedback is in order since we don’t have any such API right now</p>

<p>For COVID lab results and vaccinations we support both the SMART Health Cards and the European Digital COVID Certificate (EU DCC) standards.

Questions: What would be my engineering point of view options/guidelines if I would start working on this with the crazy idea that part of my effort might eventually help making the above mentioned “USZ database” ending up in a Swiss based version for medication features (medication interactions) which is currently only available in the US? Or simply put: what can a local independent contributor (Indie) best do to help make an US only feature also available in Switzerland? Is there a formal process that non-employees can contribute to making US only features available outside the US, e.g. in Switzerland? (the US and the Swiss Health system have a lot in common, behind the US, Swiss is 2nd country in terms of health expenditures/capita and also, there are some large local hospitals which are in the process of implementing Epic).</p>

<p>Great question!  We struggle with this too; here are the solutions we know of.
• If you haven’t seen the Features &gt; Location submenu, take a look!  it simulates the user doing a variety of workouts.
• If you start a workout in the Workout app in the simulator, that will actually start a simulated workout.
• Having a dedicated app or pre-fab script that you can trigger to just load in a ton of data custom to your use case is definitely worth the time investment.
• If you have a test account with pre-made data, if you attach the credentials to the simulator, the data will sync down from iCloud
Hope that helps!</p>

I'm concerned that my users might be confused if they deny read permission in error and no data is shown, but since apps can't determine if a user has granted or denied read access, I can't really detect that to help them out.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Because health data can be sensitive, users have granular control over what information is shared, and users must explicitly grant each app permission to read and write data to HealthKit.</p>
<p>Your app would not know the status of the permissions granted, but you can consider pointing your users to these locations to toggle their permissions.</p>
<p>To Settings or the Health App.</p>
<p>I guess the question I have is about figuring out when to do that. For instance, if I make a request for data and the result set is empty, I don’t know whether to just show an empty set, or to prompt the user to take a look at their settings (because the data set is empty because I don’t have permission). Do you have any advice on best practices for how/when to suggest to the user that they take a look?</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s a good question.  I think if there is an opportunity to show the user that you are not seeing any data, and that it is either because they are not collecting data or it’s a Settings issue</p>
<p>Related to that, is there a way to deep-link into the health privacy section of the Settings app? For other settings I’d use <code>UIApplication.openSettingsURLString</code> but since health permissions aren’t shown there I’ve been looking for another way.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You can customize heart rates zones for the Workout app on your Apple Watch through Settings &gt; Workout &gt; Heart Rate Zones and then selecting Manual.</p>
<p>Is there any API involved with Heart Rate zones?</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is not possible to access via API.</p>
<p>Oh no!</p>
<p>The feature is specific to Workout app</p>
<p>What would you be thinking of using the data for in your app? Were you looking to create heart rate zones or view zones for saved workouts?</p>
<p>IMHO the hr zones are not specific to Workout app. Athletes expect to have a single place where their hr zones are defined? Otherwise they will have to define their hr zones in all apps… this is a basic feature for all workout apps?</p>
<p>It would be nice being able to query the current user’s HR zones. The resulting data can be used both while tracking cardio activities and in results reviews &amp; statistics</p>
<p>Please provide an api to query the hr zones used for a given workout ? Could we expect it for the iOS 16 release  </p>

<p>Could you give more details. Are the VO2Max samples that are being queried beyond the earliest sample date for watch? That is one reason why you may not see data. The watch only has a limited subset of Health data</p>
<p>This is something i was experimenting a while ago but i have a FB for that: FB8959672
If i recall correctly, the vo2Max samples were from a few days (couple of week max) ago.
I didn’t know that the watch has only a time-limited set of Health data though. Thanks for that info!
Is there any way to know how much this subset spans, programmatically?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Good question. HKObserverQuery is intended to be over-eager if needed for best performance. That is - it will over-fire if it would take significant processing power to remove the extra signals. Because of that, our best practice recommendation is that the HKObserverQuery be paired with a separate query that will compute the actual final results, rather than trying to use the information from the observer query in isolation. When your updateHandler fires, you can apply your own heuristics to try to deduplicate, but after that, you should rerun the other query to make sure you get accurate results.</p>
<p>I’m also facing this. I am getting duplicates. Can you give me some hint to deduplicate.</p>
<p>I do a second query with an Anchored Object but the Observer Query fires so quickly that the anchor doesn’t have time to update :upside_down_face:</p>
<p>Unfortunately there’s no easy or obvious way - if there were, we would deduplicate for you! I meant that if your app has some special knowledge about the samples (like if they are coming from a known app), you might be able to craft a better heuristic than we could.  Without specialized information, I think you will need to redo the base query (preferably narrowed by date as much as possible, to avoid pulling more data than needed) to get an accurate picture of what has changed.</p>
<p>We would love to make the experience better for you; please do file feedbacks with context for your use case.</p>

<p>The recommended approach is to use an <code>HKLiveWorkoutDataSource</code> attached to an <code>HKLiveWorkoutBuilder</code>, which will automatically associate samples (such as distance) to the <code>HKWorkout</code>.

<p>Can you explain more about your use case?</p>
<p>We are looking into implementing utility Apps that users may open/run on their watch and then utilize Hand-Gestures to trigger simple events like Playing a sound from the Watch or maybe even on the iPhone, recording an event with a timestamp or sending a message to a server.
It would be great if we could therefore register a low profile “background service” that would be able to recognize such gestures using the gyro and motion sensors for a set time period since the Watch App was activated. I guess it would be fine if the user could cancel this mode by looking at the watch and switching back to the clock-view.</p>
<p>We don’t plan to use any heart rate measurements or other sensor data that would normally accumulate during a workout at our actual state of development.</p>

<p>Apple Watch can record an estimate of VO2 max during a brisk outdoor run, walk, or hike (and this can be outside of starting a workout). This also applies if your app uses HealthKit APIs to start a workout.</p>
<p>It can take at least 24 hours wearing Apple Watch, followed by several workouts and passive measurements with Apple Watch before receiving an estimate.</p>
<p>Health uses the following information to estimate cardio fitness, which users can enter through Health Details in the Health app: Sex, Date of Birth, Height, Weight, and medications that might affect heart rate.</p>

When I try and compute this myself (taking any positive differences in elevation) the number is ~100x higher than Apple's workout app. It would be nice if this was a metric that was provided</h4>

<p>It is calculated using altitude from location entries and is incremented when the current altitude is higher than the previous one. These values are in meters. Are you possibly using the wrong unit?</p>
