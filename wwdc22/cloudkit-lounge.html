    I'm using iCloud Drive by copying a file to the directory obtained by FileManager.default.url(forUbiquityContainerIdentifier: nil). In the case that we put a file whose file size is about 1MB, the value of NSMetadataUbiquitousItemIsUploadedKey for the saved item usually becomes true within a second under a good network condition. However, when I put the 1MB file immediately after deleting all items in the iCloud directory, the value of NSMetadataUbiquitousItemIsUploadedKey for the newly added item remains false for more than 20 seconds. Is it a limitation of CloudKit?

    Hey Patrick. I'm using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer with Core Data in my app. I've adopted the deduplication workflow detailed in the Synchronizing a local store to the cloud sample code. I noticed that when the items are fetched and inserted, the relationships are not yet updated (the relationship is nil). Later, I receive other transactions from the history where the items where updated: at this time, the relations are good. Is that the intended behaviour? I need to deduplicate my items based on a relationship, so having it nil when the transaction is of change insert does not help me.

If I have a main app and in addition to that a second app (e.g. a companion app), is there a possibility to share a record from the main app to the companion app? And if so, can I somehow specify the app I want to share the record with?   Thanks a lot for the info in advance!

    I have several thousands records in a public CloudKit database. The records are added daily and there is only a handful of new records every day. The new records are added by one central process outside of the actual iOS app. All app users need read only access to all the records. The iOS app is using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer to sync the Core Data store with the public CloudKit database. After watching the WWDC20 'Sync a Core Data store with the CloudKit public database' video I thought this sync methodology would work perfectly in the above scenario. Here is a quote from the presentation. "So we're only going to poll for changes on application launch or after about every 30 minutes of application use. And this is to ensure that we align the load of these requests with the actual usage of your applications. Of course, this does mean that the quality of freshness that you can expect from the public database will be noticeably different from the private database." In practice I encountered two issues: 1. The initial import of the records happens in batches. This is understandable since it balances the load on the CloudKit servers. However, the way the records are imported is not ideal. I had records created everyday from September to May. When the import process started users saw records from March appear in the app first. The other records were imported later. This was not ideal. I would like to have control on which records are imported first. In my scenario I would like the newest records to appear first in the application. This way users would not be confused why there are only old records visible in the app. It is much easier to explain to users that it takes time to import and that the older records are imported later, when the newest records are visible first.  2. From the above quote "poll for changes on application launch" - the poll for changes should ideally happen when application comes back to the foreground. Of course if the poll can be done only every 30 minutes, then it should be throttled accordingly. My point is that the moment when a user opens the app and looks at the data, the moment when the application comes back to the foreground, is critical from the user experience point of view and you want the data to be up to date as much as possible at this particular moment. Perhaps the app should be able to signal and ask for poll to be performed and the system would perform the poll for changes if other time related criteria are met?

    Hey there. I have two questions about CloudKit sharing.  1. If User A shares e.g. a Record with User B who has the app not installed, is iOS giving them a prompt to download the app or does the user has to do that by hand? 2. If I have a main app and in addition to that a second app (e.g. a companion app), is there a possibility to share a record from the main app to the companion app? And if so, can I somehow specify the app I want to share the record with?   Thanks a lot for the info in advance!

    I have several thousands records in a public CloudKit database. The records are added daily and there is only a handful of new records every day. The new records are added by one central process outside of the actual iOS app. All app users need read only access to all the records. The iOS app is using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer to sync the Core Data store with the public CloudKit database. After watching the WWDC20 'Sync a Core Data store with the CloudKit public database' video I thought this sync methodology would work perfectly in the above scenario. Here is a quote from the presentation. "So we're only going to poll for changes on application launch or after about every 30 minutes of application use. And this is to ensure that we align the load of these requests with the actual usage of your applications. Of course, this does mean that the quality of freshness that you can expect from the public database will be noticeably different from the private database." In practice I encountered two issues: 1. The initial import of the records happens in batches. This is understandable since it balances the load on the CloudKit servers. However, the way the records are imported is not ideal. I had records created everyday from September to May. When the import process started users saw records from March appear in the app first. The other records were imported later. This was not ideal. I would like to have control on which records are imported first. In my scenario I would like the newest records to appear first in the application. This way users would not be confused why there are only old records visible in the app. It is much easier to explain to users that it takes time to import and that the older records are imported later, when the newest records are visible first.  2. From the above quote "poll for changes on application launch" - the poll for changes should ideally happen when application comes back to the foreground. Of course if the poll can be done only every 30 minutes, then it should be throttled accordingly. My point is that the moment when a user opens the app and looks at the data, the moment when the application comes back to the foreground, is critical from the user experience point of view and you want the data to be up to date as much as possible at this particular moment. Perhaps the app should be able to signal and ask for poll to be performed and the system would perform the poll for changes if other time related criteria are met?

<h4 id="is-it-possible-to-have-hierarchical-sharing-for-nspersistentcloudkitcontainer-in-ios-16-ios-15-only-support-zone-sharing">Is it possible to have hierarchical sharing for NSPersistentCloudKitContainer in iOS 16? iOS 15 only support zone sharing.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
No. Hierarchical sharing is too limited for the purposes of NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Why would you want hierarchical shares as opposed to simply storing a graph of managed objects that represent your hierarchy in a zone?</p>
<p>|U03JNR9A2GZ|:
I have an app that has a similar structure as Notes. You can have Groups and Lists within the Groups. From what I understand, I can't share a single List without sharing the entire Group and other lists within the Group.</p>
<p>|U03JNR9A2GZ|:
Users may want to share a single List with others without having to put it into a specific shared Group.</p>
<p>I hope that is making sense :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03JNR9A2GZ|:
Hierarchical sharing would allow users to share a single List regardless of it's parent</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
That’s not entirely true. You could allow the user to nominate the list and group to share, and then break them apart such that they exist in separate logical hierarchies</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
With sharing we often have to break our notion of normalization due to different collections of actors (users) operating on some portion of a graph like this.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
You end up with:</p>
<p>Private:
• GroupA
    ◦ List1
    ◦ List2
    ◦ List3
Shared:
• GroupA
    ◦ List4
    ◦ List5</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Your UI can present all of the lists under a single group, GroupA, but some list items are operated on by the user, some by the user + share participants, etc.</p>
<p>|U03JNR9A2GZ|:
Oh interesting, I wasn't thinking I could separate the UI in that way.</p>
<p>This is very encouraging! I was starting to think I would have to move away from <code>NSPersistentCloudKitContainer</code> and write my own sync logic. I'd prefer not to :upside_down_face:</p>
<p>Thanks for the guidance!</p>
<p>|U03JE8T2Z2R|:
do we have to use CloudKit to take advantage of PassKeys?</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
&gt;  Oh interesting, I wasn’t thinking I could separate the UI in that way.
I think an NSFetchedResultsController would work with a sectionNameKeyPath of “group” if your list entity identifies its group as a string property, as opposed to a to-one-relationship to a group object.</p>
<p>That way List objects from both stores will show up in the same section of the FRC.</p>
<p>|U03HWU7EYBB|:
&lt;@U03JE8T2Z2R&gt; I just pinged the passkeys folks — there’s no dependency on CloudKit to implement passkeys in your app! You may be thinking of the <em>user requirement</em> to use iCloud Keychain in order for them to use passkeys?</p>
<p>|U03JE8T2Z2R|:
thank you, that's awesome</p>

Is it now possible to use constraints with NSPersistentCloudKitContainer? If not, what is the recommended way when importing a large amount of records?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
You should use history tracking to traverse the changes and move them between stores as efficiently as your use case desires.</p>
<p>|U03JCC3UM6G|:
so one local store with constraints and one store set up with CloudKit?</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Yeah, one store that contains your “desired” schema / constraints, and a Cloud store that syncs objects.</p>
<p>|U03JCC3UM6G|:
How do I merge the changes from one store to the other?
I have one entity set up with the needed attributes and a constraints for importing data. All added to the local configuration.
Do I now need to add a copy of this entity without the constraints in another configuration which works with CloudKit?</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Maybe?</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Everyone kind of chooses their own adventure. Sometimes the schemas are different enough that they are different entities. Sometimes they are identical, but one has stricter validation requirements.</p>
<p>|U03JCC3UM6G|:
oh wait. So when importing to the store with constraints, the history tracking will tell me only the items which actually changed? And this is the list I need to loop over to then forward these changes to the CloudKit connected store?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Uninstalling the app deletes the local store files. Your data will need to download again and this process can take some time.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
NSPersistentCloudKitContainer does not delete data unless you tell it to.</p>
<p>|U03JEL0155X|:
That is my understanding as well. On device A, I parsed a CSV to create NSManagedObjects and CloudKit showed all ~50k records. Then at some point they were deleted and only ~9k remain. No where in my code did I explicitly delete a record. I've only un/reinstalled. :disappointed:</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
I mean… did they ever finish uploading from DeviceA?</p>
<p>|U03JEL0155X|:
I believe so. A few times between uploading and reinstalling I had queried CloudKit directly to get the count and it was correct.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
It’s worth a feedback report if you have an uninstall / reinstall scenario that leads to data loss.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
But we aren’t aware of any today.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
We would want logs from the devices through the process I suspect.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
and store files if you can provide them.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Checking the CloudKit server for the number of records is right, if the count is changing something is telling us to perform operations.</p>
<p>|U03JEL0155X|:
Okay, I'll put that together and make a feedback report. Thanks.</p>
<p>|U03HJA0EJ1G|:
Uninstalled before finishing upload, or stuck before finishing download are both plausible.</p>
<p>|U03JEL0155X|:
What could cause it to get in a stuck state?</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
It’s not possible to say without logs. We could offer baseless conjecture but that’s not productive.</p>

Ex, include a version number in the column names? (primaryFamilyMemberNameV1, primaryFamilyMemberNameV2)</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
The best practice often depends on your data model, the types of changes you're making, and what sort of backward compatibility you need to maintain</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
The names themselves are more for your benefit and remembering which is which</p>
<p>|U03J4BFE17W|:
Thanks</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Something like a "v1"/"v2" could work if it's strictly a version bump of some sort, or some sort of semantic name might also make sense, e.g. "name" and "encryptedName"</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
What sort of changes are you making to the data model?</p>
<p>|U03J4BFE17W|:
Because the names are permanent, over time as we modify/update our model, we might have old unused columns that we have to coach new developers on the history and reason for each column. I was wondering if just appending a version on the column name would be appropriate or wondering if I was missing something obvious.  I appreciate your advice.</p>
<p>|U03J4BFE17W|:
Example, v1 of the app, we store GPS coords in a single string, later in v2 we split them into different columns</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
You can't rename existing field once they've deployed into production, so you are free to name the new fields in whatever scheme is most maintainable for your developers. Using <code>location</code> and <code>location_v2</code> is definitely plausible as is <code>location-latitude</code> and <code>location-longitude</code>. Just be sure you continue populating the original field if you are maintaining compatibility with older versions of your application.</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Ah interesting. Do you need to ensure that the new version of your app syncs properly with the old version? For example if someone has the new version on one device, but the old version on another?</p>
<p>|U03J4BFE17W|:
I do not, I typically block versions of the app that we no longer support. (On launch download a min version string and display a fullscreen upgrade guide)</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Nice, smart :brain:</p>
<p>|U03J4BFE17W|:
.. whenever we make breaking serverside changes etc.</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
That's usually the main worry with things like this, backward/forward compatibility</p>
<p>|U03J4BFE17W|:

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
This is typical of a process we call “seeding.”</p>
<p>Clients of NSPersistentCloudKitContainer will download data from the public database to a local sqlite file, and then</p>
<ol>
<li>copy relevant portions of that for user-specific customization</li>
<li>Reference it via a foreign key relationship from user-specific stores
Techniques vary, opting for 2 is the most efficient, but 1 offers better sync freshness because the private database is able to sync at a higher rate (via push notifications) than the public database.</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
How are you presenting the sharing controller? It sounds like you mean that it doesn’t present when you use the other initializer?</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Alternatively, is the view controller presenting but encountering an error during the create-share phase? i.e. when your preparation handler is called?</p>
<p>|U03J2019QTV|:
I present it as a .sheet in SwiftUI. It does actually present a sheet, but the sheet is empty and stays that way. The preparationHandler is never called.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
I see. For UICloudSharingController we typically present it like this in swift UI samples:</p>
<pre><code>UIApplication.shared.rootController()?.present(sharingController, animated: true).
</code></pre>
<p>|U03J2019QTV|:

<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
There's no way to force a sync with NSPersistentCloudKitContainer, but we'd love to see some logs where the sync is only happening intermittently</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Would you be able to install the CloudKit logging profile, reproduce the intermittent sync problem, and file a bug through Feedback Assistant?</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Also, we fixed some problems with syncs not happening fast enough in iOS 15.5 (and 16). Are you still seeing issue there?</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
The logging profile can be found here: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/profiles-and-logs/?platform=ios">https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/profiles-and-logs/?platform=ios</a></p>
<p>|U03JRPFE82C|:
Yeah, pretty sure we could still see it in iOS 15.5. I’ll report a problem Feedback Assistant next week.</p>
<p>It seems to only sync when the app is sent to the foreground/background for example. We have a feature where the user modifies data on one device, and we want it to instantly (if possible ofc) reflect on all the devices. Preferably also on Widgets/Complications. :sweat_smile:</p>
<p>|U03JM8PFK2P|:
Thank for the info. I was hoping sync with a public CloudKit database would happen shortly after an app is launched by a user. In practice it might take quite some time to sync. Where sync the other way, from ;a local core data to CloudKit happens very quickly. That's my experience.</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
&lt;@U03JM8PFK2P&gt; would you be able to file a bug through Feedback Assistant too?</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Ideally we could get logs from both the saving device and fetching device along with approximate timestamps of when the data was saved</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Syncing in the background is a bit trickier to due competing system resources, but we do attempt to do so if possible</p>
<p>|U03JM8PFK2P|:
Sure, will try to replicate the stated behavior and report. Thanks!</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Thanks!</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Widgets and complications are an interesting situation too since there has to be a balance of performance and power efficiency with data freshness</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
That said, there might be something we could do better that we're not doing right now</p>
<p>|U03HJA0EJ1G|:
Widgets are a challenge, because the system doesn't give them much time to do any kind of background network operations</p>
<p>|U03JRPFE82C|:
&lt;@U03HJA0EJ1G&gt; Yeah exactly, we got our core data model in an App Group shared with the main-app. So anything synced by the main-app will be available in the widget. I think. :smile:</p>
<p>|U03HJA0EJ1G|:
Yes, the foibles occur primarily when the app is NOT running.  But if it is, you should see changes from NSPersistentCloudKitContainerEvent and NSPersistentStoreRemoteChangeNotification if you set that up</p>
<p>|U03JRPFE82C|:
So in theory we just need a callback in the main-app. And once it has been synced the main-app could request a Widget re-render. But as said, we need a notification.</p>
<p>|U03JRPFE82C|:
&lt;@U03HJA0EJ1G&gt; Ok, cool! So these notifications don’t init my app if it’s not running?</p>
<p>|U03HJA0EJ1G|:
correct.  The WidgeKit team might have some thoughts but AFAIK you can't get the widget to force the app to launch</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
No.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
work is scheduled based on a number of criteria, but there is no manual sync option. If you have feedback regarding sync quality or freshness you can file a feedback report with a sysdiagnose so we can investigate.</p>
<p>|U03JM8PFK2P|:
Thanks. I was commenting in the previous question workflow. Will report back on sync quality. Specifically, how long it takes to sync public database changes when an app is lunched by a user. I understand that a sync of public database does not happen very often. However, an amount of time from a launch to sync is quite important for an overall user experience. Thanks!</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
The public database has a much lower expectation of sync freshness. An initial import will be performed immediately for empty store files. However subsequent imports will occur approximately once a day .</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
It’s impossible to say without a sysdiagnose from the affected devices.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
In fact devices on different iCloud accounts maybe experiencing different root causes.</p>
<p>|U03JH1D27C1|:
I’ve filed FB10080487 related to this.</p>
<p>|U03JH1D27C1|:
Can you give any examples of potential root causes, so i can report back to the users if I’m unable to gather their sysdiagnose?</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
One possibility is that they have the iCloud Drive switch disabled, and that switch also disables sync for apps using CloudKit</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
There's also a switch underneath iCloud Drive for your app, which might be disabled as well</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
&lt;@U03JH1D27C1&gt; regarding FB10080487, we'll need a logging profile installed and a sysdiagnose to triage further</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
If either of those switches are disabled, you'll get <code>CKErrorNotAuthenticated</code> (9)</p>
<p>|U03JH1D27C1|:
Thanks. In these instances the user’s settings all appear fine and other apps sync just fine. This also seems to affect quite a few users, although not super widespread.</p>
<p>As is quite often the case it’s almost impossible to get a sysdiagnose from a user, let alone have them install a debugging profile.</p>
<p>|U03HZ479SGM|:
This combination of switches has been a pain to manage from the usability stand-point.  what <em>is</em> iCloud Drive, and why would users want/need to disable it?</p>
<p>|U03JH1D27C1|:
(and it’s not an issue I can replicate)</p>
<p>|U03JH1D27C1|:
Yes, and also, on Mac, the hierarchy is different, where many users don’t have to explicitly turn on iCloud Drive before, which is required before enabling your app.</p>
<p>|U03HJA0EJ1G|:
Settings don't follow the same switches</p>

Sorry for delay, was just trying out Act as iCloud. The problem I've faced for a long time is I'm signed into other <a href="http://apple.com|apple.com">http://apple.com|apple.com</a> services like forums etc as my personal account. So when I sign into icloud dashboard as my developer account I can no longer use any other <a href="http://apple.com|apple.com">http://apple.com|apple.com</a> e.g. i can't post on the forums.</p>
<p>|U03J1V9TNLT|:
One way to solve that would be if I could just give my personal account full permissions to access my icloud dashboard developer account. Another way if icloud dashboard sign in could simply be decoupled from all Apple services.</p>
<p>|U03J1V9TNLT|:
But I appreciate now being able to view records created by my personal iphone on CloudKit Dash which was always a bit of a mystery.</p>

<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
You should be able to add text to the share via <code>CKShareTitleKey</code>/<code>CKShare.SystemFieldKey.title</code>
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/cksharetitlekey">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/cksharetitlekey</a></p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:

<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/cksharethumbnailimagedatakey">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/cksharethumbnailimagedatakey</a></p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
You'd set those values on the <code>CKShare</code> itself when saving it</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
E.g.</p>
<pre><code>let share = CKShare()
share[CKShare.SystemFieldKey.title] = &quot;The best share in the world&quot;

<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Although if you're seeing problems with that approach, then let us know</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
Of course, but those are part of the tiny CKShare link.

I could use UIActivityViewController with two items [image, shareURLItemProvider]. This should do the trick (partly)</p>

<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
However for adding people (so it not being a public share) I would love to have some options in the UIActivityViewController like Photos does, but I have not found anything about that - seems I again hit a private API wall.</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Yeah it would be nice if you could add the photo as well. I'm able to see the feedback (FB10037244), and I'll make sure it gets routed to the right place</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
Just to clarify, are you looking to send a predefined message from your app or user provided text?</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
I would like to send the preview-thumbnail with the CKShare as it is not utilized by the share link. So that the post is more noticable.</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
My current alternative is to create public CKRecord, that has the thumbnail and CKShareLink, and create my own link that nicely represents that share and forwards it to the ckshare link if the user clicks it.</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
Got it, the SharedWithYou support currently (Beta, subject to change) allows the sender to provide some text along with the document similar to the Notes example above</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
Would that create something like the Notes app does (poste above)?</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
Btw. huge disadvantage of that approach is, that probably safari opened first every time one clicks that link - unless I can detect on .htaccess level wether the link is scanned for visual representation or actually being opened (e.g. by user agent :)</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
I'd caution that approach, while link sharing is designed to be public saving the <code>shareURL</code> in the publicDB means it is globally accessible and may cause unexpected users to join the share</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
Absolutely I would simply be an interim approach until the share link can look cool :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
Understood, we definitely are always looking for ways to improve the experience here. While you are free to customize the behavior as you see fit our generally recommendation would be to use the standard link sharing flow so you can take advantage of any system improvements that are made over time</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
I could fully avoid creating the public record, if it was possible to somehow read the thumbnail from the CKShare from CloudKit JS by giving it the ShareURL. Is that possible?</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
The thumbnail will be available on the <code>CKShare</code> on the <code>CKShareMetadata</code> fetched from the <code>shareURL</code> via <code>CKFetchShareMetadataOperation</code> . As far as I can tell this should also be possible via CloudKitJS</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
The question is: Since this is about generating a link the server has no AppleID attached the moment it is trying to get the metadata. Can that even work? For any CKShare or at least for public ones?</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
To clarify, do you mean via CloudKit.framework or CloudKitJS?</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
CloudKit JS (the Idea would be to create a pretty link by offering my own website (detecting the user agent and thus distinguishing wether a a user clicked on the link (and I thus Foward to the original link) or if it’s an agent trying to generate a pretty web link thus giving back the info for title and preview image.</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
I am currently doing that for public CKRecords, but I want to do that for CKShare URLs to make those look prettier.</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
Sadly one downside already seems that it has to be a public share I guess - but maybe I can live with that.</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
Correct, you can interact with records but not <code>shareURL</code> or <code>CKShareMetadata</code> and hence you don't have a clear path to access the <code>CKShare</code></p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
I can say this, we've heard your feedback on how to make the sharing experience via Messages better and very much appreciate it</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
Yes once that is implemented I don’t have to worry any more and don’t need to do any coding.</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
However I considered doing part of that work anyway, to allow users to play on the web using their AppleID. (so I don’ have to build an android version or such :grimacing:)</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
I have not fully understood your “Correct, …” answer. You mean I can access CKShareMetadata IF it’s public, via CloudKit JS without any Apple ID directly from PHP?</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
I have not found anything about fetching CKShareMetadata in CloudKit JS documentation. Any hint where to start?</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
Sorry for the confusion, CloudKitJS does not currently support accepting shares via a <code>shareURL</code> and therefore converting a <code>shareURL</code> into share metadata so that unfortunately does not seem to be a viable workaround</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
That is surprising, as I can offer a fallback URL for CKShare URLs on the CloudKit Dashboard. This fallback URL does get the CKShare ID, so I assumed it would be to offer something on the web, but if I understand you correctly ONLY if the user already joined?</p>
<p>|U03JRP33VR6|:
If that is true, you just saved me a LOT of work :slightly_smiling_face: (with the consequence of offering one less service to users) So instead of coding I will do a BugReport :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:

<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
Take a look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks|Background Tasks">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks|Background Tasks</a> which will allow your app to periodically run in the background to keep content up to date</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Hey Niels! I think we talked in the lab just now. Ideally, all this would be handled for you automatically via NSPersistentCloudKitContainer, but you may be able to request more background runtime via the background task APIs Matt linked to</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Until we figure out why we're not doing it automatically for you, you may be able to trick the system into giving you background time with the BGTask APIs so that you can continue syncing in the background</p>
<p>|U03J20XDZ3L|:
Thanks. What I notice is that the core data / cloudkit log events immediately stop popping up in Xcode as soon as the app goes to the background. Hence, it feels like NSPersistentCloudKitContainer internally just stops syncing.</p>
<p>|U03J20XDZ3L|:
I will experiment with background tasks, but that feels like a bit of a workaround to me.</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
That is generally correct, when your app transitions into a suspended state the process is in a suspended state and no forward progress will be made until something wakes the process up, like a background task</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Agreed that it's more of a workaround than a long-term solution, and we should be able to sync in the background without you having to explicitly take out those background tasks</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Implementing sharing is possible on Apple Watch, but there's no system UI for the user to start sharing (e.g. no UICloudSharingController) on watchOS</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
The code for the shared and public database are the same on all platforms</p>

This sounds like a good use-case for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckdatabasesubscription|CKDatabaseSubscription">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckdatabasesubscription|CKDatabaseSubscription</a>. You can subscribe to notifications on User B’s shared database, so when User A modifies that shared record, User B will receive a notification that there is a change to their shared database. You’d then need to handle that notification and fetch the latest from the shared database. There are additional useful docs on the <code>CKSubscription</code> class <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/cksubscription|here">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/cksubscription|here</a>.</p>
<p>|U03JLTMSAV7|:
I would like to have <code>CKQuerySubscription</code> also available for shared databases. In this case, User A can set up a query subscription for their private database. If user B modifies the record, A gets notified about the specific changed record. However, for user B, only <code>CKDatabaseSubscription</code> is available, they get notified "something changed" which isn’t really appropriate for e.g directly displaying to user as push notification.</p>

As you are aware, <code>CKQuerySubscriptions</code> are not available for the shared database.

You can monitor sync progress via <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcloudkitcontainer/event|NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.Event">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcloudkitcontainer/event|NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.Event</a> on both the export and import side which can be used to provide feedback to your users on the state of the sync.

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
There are a few different approaches you can take, but the most common is to avoid downloading large CKAssets unless the user needs them</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
This is relatively straightforward if you're using CloudKit directly, but not if you're using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
&lt;@U03JFQ1BQMA&gt; Are you using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer?</p>
<p>|U03JFQ1BQMA|:
I am yes</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
That might be a bit more nuanced. Tagging &lt;@U03HMJ2P5MJ&gt; who is in the Core Data labs right now, but hopefully when he's free he can help</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
For anyone reading this who might be using CloudKit directly (&lt;@U03J1V9TNLT&gt; I see your :eyes:, although maybe you're using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer too), you can specify <code>desiredKeys</code> when fetching your records. You'd exclude any keys that contain <code>CKAssets</code>. Then, when the user performs some action that requires the asset, you'd fetch the record with that asset key in the <code>desiredKeys</code> to finally fetch the asset file</p>
<p>|U03HJA44L0J|:
Do also note that the device does attempt to free up space in these situations and they can be (and hopefully are) transient in nature, therefore if you can reduce farther impact to the user's disk space, great, but don't permanently stop syncing in response to low disk space</p>
<p>|U03JFQ1BQMA|:
Fair enough. I'm wondering if things could potentially go quite wrong and potentially result in data loss :thinking_face:</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
I don’t think we can say. If the device runs out of disk space and we can’t import any data, that data is still on the server.</p>
<p>|U03JFQ1BQMA|:
So there would not be anything specific my app would need to do?</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Yeah there’s nothing to do really</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
The user needs to free up disk space and then syncing will resume.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
You should ensure your application responds to this gracefully, i.e. by not executing a batch delete request to attempt to free up disk space for them.</p>
<p>|U03JFQ1BQMA|:
Fair enough. Are there ways I can test this scenario (short of filling up my device with data) to ensure my app wouldn't crash for some reason?</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Yes, we usually create a disk image with limited space on a mac and point the tests at that.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Fill it up and watch what the app does.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
IIRC this also works in the simulator.</p>
<p>|U03JFQ1BQMA|:
Good to know! I'll look into that. Thanks all :thumbsup:</p>

<p>|U03HZ1C3YKE|:
Hi Brady :wave:</p>
<p>The error you’re seeing can happen when you haven’t set up indexes for your recordType in the Console.</p>
<p>Could you please try the following:
1. Navigate to <em>Indexes</em> under the <em>Schema</em> heading in the sidebar
2. Select the recordType that you want to make queries against
3. Click “Add Basic Index”
4. In the “Field” dropdown select “recordName”
5. In the “Index Type” select “queryable”
6. Press “Save Changes”</p>
<p>|U03HZ1C3YKE|:
After that you should be able to query the recordType. If not we can work through any issues here.</p>
<p>|U03K7L2F51P|:
Thanks Chris! After setting up indexes for recordType, the query no longer produces an error and instead shows results :tada:</p>
<p>|U03K7L2F51P|:
Would I also need to set up indexes to resolve the other two errors?
&gt; "Queried type is not marked indexable"
&gt; "Can't query system types"</p>
<p>|U03HZ1C3YKE|:
That’s correct, you’ll need to continue adding indexes to fields if you want them to be <code>Searchable</code> , <code>Sortable</code> or <code>Queryable</code></p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
This is a fun one. You'd basically want to use some sort of conflict-free data structure (a CRDT would work, as you mentioned)</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
If you figure that out, then offline editing will work just fine because every device will become eventually consistent</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
CloudKit doesn't have any special support for automatically handling merge conflicts, so you'll still have to handle conflicts on the device (<code>CKErrorServerRecordChanged</code>), but handling those conflicts will be easy because your data is inherently mergeable</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
You can get real-time performance via SharePlay just like you mentioned as well</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
I'm not aware of any mergeable data/CRDT libraries off the top of my head, but I'm sure there's something out there. That's the main way you'll be able to support these concurrent edits</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
As for using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer, that would probably be ideal and save you a lot of work, although I'm not super familiar with how merge conflicts are handled there. &lt;@U03HMJ2P5MJ&gt; is it possible to define an NSMergePolicy where you can perform a CRDT merge on a conflict?</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
If you use a CRDT with contributions modeled as rows it would work just fine</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
you just traverse the contributions</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
and NSPersistentCloudKitContainer can do the shuffling (or you could shuffle them via SharePlay).</p>
<p>|U03J20E1BPD|:
&lt;@U03HMJ2P5MJ&gt; Sorry I’m not very familiar with the terminologies. Did you mean I should record all the history entries in a giant table? What did you mean by “shuffling”?</p>
<p>|U03J20E1BPD|:
Also, I read somewhere that you’re not supposed to use device timestamps in CRDT implementations. Something called Lamport timestamp? Is this important?</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
NSPersistentHistoryTransaction / NSPersistentHistoryChange are just records of changes. They do not contain any useful information to send to other devices.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
&gt;  Something called Lamport timestamp? Is this important?
Yes. That is one of the fundamental mathematical concepts for CRDTs.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
&gt;  is it possible to define an NSMergePolicy where you can perform a CRDT merge on a conflict?
No but we would take a feedback report for that</p>
<p>|U03J20E1BPD|:
“NSPersistentHistoryTransaction / NSPersistentHistoryChange are just records of changes. They do not contain any useful information to send to other devices.” Sorry… not good at Core Data… I don’t quite understand this.</p>
<p>|U03J1V9TNLT|:
Those are built in change tracking tables that are created when turning on persistent history tracking. He says you cannot use those for collaboration because they don't contain the data  that changed. You need to store data changes in your own entities, sync those via CloudKit, and use those changes to build up the current state.</p>
<p>|U03J20E1BPD|:
Thank you for the explanation &lt;@U03J1V9TNLT&gt;!</p>

<p>|U03KECFPY73|:
If there are a large number of deletes for iCloud Drive to process, this can delay the speed at which it processes the new file creation which can result in a longer upload time.</p>

We'd like to look at this a little more closely though to make sure nothing is going wrong here. Can you install the iCloud Drive debug profile and then file a feedback?</p>

I'm using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer with Core Data in my app. I've adopted the deduplication workflow detailed in the Synchronizing a local store to the cloud sample code.

Later, I receive other transactions from the history where the items where updated: at this time, the relations are good. Is that the intended behaviour?

Yes this is expected. You will need to wait for NSPersistentCloudKitContainer to saturate the related objects before you can dedupe them.</p>

Is there a way he could have restored his data? Either via a UI or via Apple Support?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Did they delete the data via the Manage Storage API in Settings? Or via your app?</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
In general, if you delete data from CloudKit, it will be gone forever</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
This is both a good thing (we don't keep data that the user thinks is deleted) and a bad thing (the user might lose data like this)</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
One thing that some apps do is to introduce the concept of "Recently Deleted" data that can be recovered</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
That would just be normal data in the database, but shown in a different place in the UI (for example the Recently Deleted folder in Notes)</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
You could even keep user-deleted data around in your database temporarily, but with a flag that hides it from the UI. Then at some point you clean it up (e.g. after 30 days or something)</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
But sadly for this particular user, if the data is deleted from CloudKit, it's unrecoverable</p>

<p>|U03JR9WQELV|:
The best practice here is to promote schema changes before submitting an app for review. The App Review team would be looking for a full app experience which I assume includes using the latest schema for your app.</p>

I have two questions about CloudKit sharing.  1. If User A shares e.g. a Record with User B who has the app not installed, is iOS giving them a prompt to download the app or does the user has to do that by hand? 2. If I have a main app and in addition to that a second app (e.g. a companion app), is there a possibility to share a record from the main app to the companion app? And if so, can I somehow specify the app I want to share the record with?   Thanks a lot for the info in advance!</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
If a user taps on a CloudKit sharing link, but they don't have the app installed, the system will prompt them to open the App Store and install the app</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
As for the companion app, CloudKit sharing is tied to the CloudKit container, not the app itself. So as long as the second app also has access to the CloudKit container, it can share data with the main app</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
You wouldn't be able to specify which app to share the record with, but if the user has both apps installed, they'll be able to choose which app to open the share link</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
If they only have one of the two apps installed, then it'll open in the installed app</p>
<p>|U03JHD6Q60H|:
Thanks. If no app of the both is installed, probably the prompt asks to install the app from wich the sharing was initiated?</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
If neither app is installed, we'll prompt to install one or the other, but no guarantees on which one</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
I don't believe we store the app that actually initiated the share, so we can't necessarily choose which one, although that's worth a feature request via Feedback Assistant</p>

I wanted to prefill data for my users...</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03JR9WQELV|:
My first question is: why the pre-filled data not hard-coded into the app? (trying to save you from a slow first user experience)</p>
<p>|U03JR9WQELV|:
If the data is changing, I may suggest having a single  versioned asset file (instead of many records) uploaded to PublicDB. For upload and management, you could potentially use the CloudKit Console.</p>
<p>|U03JRNE4KJL|:
1. to reduce app size
2. being in the public db there is no need to bundle it with each app as its “global”
3. being able to update regualrly without app review</p>
<p>|U03JRNE4KJL|:
The CloudKit Console and Dashboard improved over the years, that’s great!</p>
<p>|U03JRNE4KJL|:
And I’ll be honest, I haven’t touched it in recent months. But for a former client, we wanted to prepolulate the public DB and ebing flexible on date and bulk up-/download was essential.</p>
<p>|U03JRNE4KJL|:
All I could figure out was to develop a companion app and up/download iteratively but it was super weak and slowwww….</p>
<p>|U03JR9WQELV|:
Uploads depend on number of records and assets and their size + network conditions. Also, that might impact first UX. That's why I suggested using a single file with the "compressed" records and assets.</p>
<p>|U03JRNE4KJL|:
Indeed for 1st launch experience, we have the most recent “copy” inside of the app (and for supporting offline-1st-approach).</p>
<p>|U03JRNE4KJL|:
Still the question holds: can we bulk up/download to CloudKit somehow relaibly and fast?</p>

<p>|U03K7L2F51P|:

Ah, found it</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Ah, can you try switching the APS environment to <code>production</code>?</p>
<p>|U03K7L2F51P|:
I was just reading about doing that - came across a few posts that say when archiving a project for submitting to the App Store, Xcode will automatically change that value to "production"</p>
<p>|U03K7L2F51P|:
So do I need to manually change it now? Or does Xcode manage that setting for me after the entitlement is added?</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
Hmm, it might, but you should generally use the production APS environment</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
So you should manually change it now</p>
<p>|U03HJ9HCBFV|:
This is separate from the CloudKit environment (kind of confusing, unfortunately)</p>
<p>|U03K7L2F51P|:
Ok, I manually changed it. I assume I won't know if that fixes the sync issue on my production app on device until I submit an app update that includes that manual change, correct?</p>

We do not recommend attempting to manually control sync state in this way. Users control the ability of your application to sync using the application’s switch in Settings.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
Removing the cloudKitContainerOptions from a store, and then reusing that store file creates a number of privacy and identity issues that NSPersistentCloudKitContainer cannot recover from if the user changes the iCloud account on their device.</p>
<p>|U03JBGPGQCF|:
Understood. So is it ok to just start sync without asking the user since they are signed into iCloud? I'm dealing with sensitive data and want to give users a choice to start sync.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
We would advise that you use a separate store file for that.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
i.e. one store file that’s always local, never synced.</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
If they opt-in you can move that data to a synced store file</p>
<p>|U03HMJ2P5MJ|:
This gives the user an explicit-cannot-be-confused-by-application-logic / store files way to opt in to syncing their sensitive data.</p>
<p>|U03JBGPGQCF|:
Thank you, that sounds like a perfect solution.</p>

The records are added daily and there is only a handful of new records every day. The new records are added by one central process outside of the actual iOS app. All app users need read only access to all the records. The iOS app is using NSPersistentCloudKitContainer to sync the Core Data store with the public CloudKit database. After watching the WWDC20 'Sync a Core Data store with the CloudKit public database' video I thought this sync methodology would work perfectly in the above scenario. Here is a quote from the presentation. "So we're only going to poll for changes on application launch or after about every 30 minutes of application use. And this is to ensure that we align the load of these requests with the actual usage of your applications. Of course, this does mean that the quality of freshness that you can expect from the public database will be noticeably different from the private database." In practice I encountered two issues: 1. The initial import of the records happens in batches. This is understandable since it balances the load on the CloudKit servers. However, the way the records are imported is not ideal. I had records created everyday from September to May. When the import process started users saw records from March appear in the app first. The other records were imported later. This was not ideal. I would like to have control on which records are imported first. In my scenario I would like the newest records to appear first in the application. This way users would not be confused why there are only old records visible in the app. It is much easier to explain to users that it takes time to import and that the older records are imported later, when the newest records are visible first.  2. From the above quote "poll for changes on application launch" - the poll for changes should ideally happen when application comes back to the foreground. Of course if the poll can be done only every 30 minutes, then it should be throttled accordingly. My point is that the moment when a user opens the app and looks at the data, the moment when the application comes back to the foreground, is critical from the user experience point of view and you want the data to be up to date as much as possible at this particular moment. Perhaps the app should be able to signal and ask for poll to be performed and the system would perform the poll for changes if other time related criteria are met?</h4>

For (1) please file an enhancement request via <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant">https://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant</a> for support to import the data in reverse</p>

For (2), again please file an enhancement request via <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant">https://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant</a> regarding your expectations for your application for when syncs should occur with the public database</p>
<p>|U03HJA0EJ1G|:
the primary approach to work around that today (not ideal, just saying how some folks have managed) is to download the data into a cloud store and separately move it over into a separate local store</p>
<p>|U03HJA0EJ1G|:
the record copying (importing and exporting, really) between your cloud and local stores can do anything.  prioritize, de-dupe, use features in the local store unavailable to cloudkit, etc.</p>
<p>|U03HJA0EJ1G|:
it should be polling on foreground, hmm, but we might have only done that for private databases.  It's worth a feedback report.</p>
<p>|U03JM8PFK2P|:
Great. Thank you for your comments. Really appreciated. I will file enhancement/feedback requests.</p>
