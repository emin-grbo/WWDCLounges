    When creating a MenuBarExtra, is it possible to create something that runs on its own, separate from the parent app? I have an app that users can save data to by means of various app extensions. If the app is closed, however, those changes don't get synced to CloudKit. I was thinking of having a menu bar app that would essentially be my workaround: always listening, always active.

In my case, I had to work to with 4 digit numbers, and a stepper wasn't the best choice. Instead, I went for a TextField that checks if it can convert the input string to an Int when a button is clicked. Is there a better way to achieve this?

    My question is about some code in the SwiftUI Cookbook for Navigation session. Around 23 minutes in, Curt uses the task modifier to run an async for loop over the model's objectWillChange publisher. In the loop, he then accesses an @Published property of the model. But a @Published property fires the objectWillChange property before it updates its wrappedValue. Doesn't that mean that when the code accesses navModel.jsonData, it will get the out-of-date model values? Or is there some async magic that guarantees the loop body will not run until later after the objectWillChange publisher has finished publishing and the @Published property has updated its wrappedValue?

    Hi! Hope non-standard behavior out of SwiftUI is your cup of tea, because I have a really “interesting” question. This happens using SwiftUI in Xcode 13.4 on an iMac running macOS 12.4. When using .datePickerStyle(.compact), and I touch the date to bring up the calendar, the final displayed date changes format depending on the chosen date. “June 19, 2022” looks ok, but then I get “6/20/22” when I move to the next day. It gets better: after going left to right in the month, and seeing “6/22/22”, when I start moving right to left from June 24, 2022, the output for the 22nd comes out as “June 22, 2022”. Any ideas would be welcome! Apologies for the weird problem!

Passing the entire primary StateObject to the detail view can expose more data to the detail view than necessary.

    Is there a method to modify or specify the label style of a chart? For instance, my chart includes price averages for home heating oil. I want to clearly display on the label that the Double is in dollar format on the Y axis.   At this time, when I attempted a brief demo app it simply made the Y axis label as an Int.

    The charts are amazing! I saw the example for the Interval Bar Chart in the docs and it got me thinking I could represent a simple weekly view of a student's course schedule if I flipped the axis. I made a proof of concept and it worked really well! I calculate the duration of a meeting in minutes to create the size of the BarMark using yStart and yEnd. Is this a good way to do this or can it be achieved with just the start date time and end date time? I also had to reverse the chartYScale to get the AM meetings to apear first, not sure if that is expected or not.  struct Series: Identifiable {     let courseName: String     let meetings: [Meeting]     var id: String { courseName } } struct Meeting {     let startDate: Date     let endDate: Date     let startMinute: Double //Minutes since 7am     let endMinute: Double }   Chart(data) { series in   ForEach(series.meetings, id: .startDate) { element in      BarMark(            x: .value("Course", element.startDate, unit: .day),             yStart: .value("Start Time", element.startMinute),          yEnd: .value("End Time", element.endMinute)         ).annotation(position: .overlay, alignment: .top) {             VStack {                Text(series.courseName).font(.caption)              Text(element.startDate.stringValue(dateFormat: .time)).font(.caption)           }       }   }   .cornerRadius(8.0)  .foregroundStyle(by: .value("Course", series.courseName)) } .chartYAxis {   AxisMarks(position: .leading, values: .stride(by: 60)) { axis in        AxisTick()      AxisGridLine()      AxisValueLabel(centered: false) {           if axis.index+7 &lt; 13 {               Text("(axis.index+7) AM")          } else {                Text("((axis.index+7)-12) PM")             }       }   } }.chartXAxis {    AxisMarks(position: .top, values: daysOfTheWeek) { _ in         AxisGridLine()      AxisTick()      AxisValueLabel(centered: true)  } }.chartYScale(domain: .automatic(reversed: true))

    As of Xcode 13, there are some gotchas with SwiftUI Previews and custom build configurations not named Debug or Release.  • SwiftUI Previews are not compiled-out unless the active build configuration is exactly named Release. • Source files under the Preview Content directory are compiled-out for non-debug builds (whether this is looking for the active build configuration to not-be-named “Debug” or whether it’s based on code optimization levels, I do not know)  So, what this means is…  • If you have a custom build configuration, say a “Staging” or “Beta” or whatever, which is essentially a variant of “Release”…. • And if you have SwiftUI Previews in your app… • And if those previews are not wrapped in #if DEBUG directives… • And if you have source code to support SwiftUI Previews stashed under the “Preview Content” directory…  Then your project will likely fail to build, as the previews will not be compiled out, but they will depend upon development asset code in “Preview Content” that is compiled out.  Do you know if this is resolved in Xcode 14?

    Hi there! This is not really related to the Layouts video we just watched, but rather a question that I had a while ago. The video was really clear. Thanks for the amazing explanations!  Moving on to the question, dan we use SwiftUI to create a numeric text field? I was looking for something that allows typing Int numbers.   In my case, I had to work to with 4 digit numbers, and a stepper wasn't the best choice. Instead, I went for a TextField that checks if it can convert the input string to an Int when a button is clicked. Is there a better way to achieve this?

    Heya! I have a macOS app where I am attempting to 'tear off' certain SwiftUI views as floating free form windows. I've looked into some of the WindowGroup API, but it doesn't seem like it supports what I'm looking for. Essentially, I have N views of various sizes that can either be docked into a main window, or float above it. I'm running in to issues like sharing state between the docked version and the windowed one, as there seems to be a difference in the relationship between how a standard SwiftUI update bindings works for windows or views. Given that, what would be some ways that I could go about this method of 'docking / undocking' SwiftUI views, and keeping their state in tact?  Thank you!

But a @Published property fires the objectWillChange property before it updates its wrappedValue. Doesn't that mean that when the code accesses navModel.jsonData, it will get the out-of-date model values?

It gets better: after going left to right in the month, and seeing “6/22/22”, when I start moving right to left from June 24, 2022, the output for the 22nd comes out as “June 22, 2022”.

    Hi there, is there any way to get my offscreen nested StateObjects to not be deallocated when scrolled offscreen within a LazyStack?

    Is there a recommended best practice for managing StateObjects/ObservableObjects in a primary-detail type setup? I've been commonly using StateObject(wrappedValue:) to inject a stateobject into a detail view, but of course because wrappedValue is an autoclosure it doesn't get updates to the data value that may occur from the primary view. Passing the entire primary StateObject to the detail view can expose more data to the detail view than necessary. And creating and managing an ObservableObject owned by the primary StateObject can be boilerplatey and messy to manage. Any approaches I've overlooked, or tips on how to approach those tradeoffs?

    As of Xcode 13, there are some gotchas with SwiftUI Previews and custom build configurations not named Debug or Release.  • SwiftUI Previews are not compiled-out unless the active build configuration is exactly named Release. • Source files under the Preview Content directory are compiled-out for non-debug builds (whether this is looking for the active build configuration to not-be-named “Debug” or whether it’s based on code optimization levels, I do not know)  So, what this means is…  • If you have a custom build configuration, say a “Staging” or “Beta” or whatever, which is essentially a variant of “Release”…. • And if you have SwiftUI Previews in your app… • And if those previews are not wrapped in #if DEBUG directives… • And if you have source code to support SwiftUI Previews stashed under the “Preview Content” directory…  Then your project will likely fail to build, as the previews will not be compiled out, but they will depend upon development asset code in “Preview Content” that is compiled out.  Do you know if this is resolved in Xcode 14?

When DTS confirms that the issue raised is a bug and a bug is filed by the developer, would it make sense if DTS can mark it as a verified bug so that it gets the attention of the relevant team?</p>

Apple Developer Forums have lots of unanswered questions, especially the complex ones / edge cases. Also, there’s sadly little engagement from the community as a whole, so if an Apple engineer misses the question, you’re out of luck.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
It entirely depends on your use case! We ultimately trust your sense of design on this one since only you know what’s right for your app. To give some general guidance though: Take native elements as far as you can, and if you find you need further customization beyond that to finely polish the experience, then don’t be afraid to use it!</p>
<p>One quick disclaimer: It can be easy to drop to custom layouts prematurely. Stacks and Grids are incredibly powerful already, so be sure you can’t get what you need with them before you use the new layout protocol. (edited)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
Yes!</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
To animate between layouts you'll need to switch between the layouts using <code>AnyLayout</code>  for example:</p>
<pre><code>let layout = isVertical ? AnyLayout(VStack()) : AnyLayout(HStack())
layout {
    Text(&quot;Hi&quot;)
    Text(&quot;World&quot;)
}
</code></pre>

<p>It might be good to sign up for a lab so that we can discuss the specific of your use case and give you targeted advices</p>
<p>|U03HPNHKJFR|:
I tried signing up for a lab and was denied. It seems the demand is too high for what you guys are able to provide. That is an absolute shame</p>
<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
You can also try the DTS Open Hours labs, and I can help you there as well.</p>
<p>|U03HPNHKJFR|:
That's the one I signed up for... and was denied</p>
<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
There are DTS labs throughout the week, so you may have missed the first set of appointments. There are still many more openings, though!</p>
<p>It would be great to capture your use case in Feedback Assistant before the labs as well, so we can get started quickly or can follow up after the conference, if needed.</p>
<p>|U03HPNHKJFR|:
I was hoping to have some type of lab each day. Having requested that one and then denied, precluded me from requesting any other lab for the day. It's frustrating. I don't know whether I'll get a single lab in this week at this rate. I'll try and use Feedback Assistant like you said, but I don't know about using it in this way... I've only ever used it to send bug reports and feature suggestions. This would be entirely different. I'm new to WWDC this year, and so far this has been a soured experience</p>

It is! I made one like this while putting the talk together, I can't remember exactly how I did it. I may have used an <code>AreaMark</code></p>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
that fills the area under the line, and they also stack to make some really cool area charts</p>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
When you're making those kinds of charts, using <code>Color.clear</code> as a part of your gradient makes the Chart look a lot neater in light and dark appearances IMO</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7BQQNPJ|:
<code>onReceive</code> is specifically to subscribe to Combine’s <code>Publisher</code> types and produce a side effect.</p>
<p><code>onChange</code> is used to produce a side effect when a property of your view changes. For example you can use that to produce a side effect when the scene phase in the environment changes.</p>
<p>|U03HMDKEWJK|:
Okay, thank you for the explanation! If I use both .onReceive and .onChange on a Published property, will there be a difference in behaviour and is one recommended over the other in this case?</p>
<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
It really depends on your use case: Is the value equatable? Is it a lightweight event? Does your view have constraints to adhere to, such as de-duping, debouncing, exponential backoff, etc.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
Our recommendation is still to thoroughly test your model layer. In my experience, the best SwiftUI apps move their logic into model code, using SwiftUI as a declarative mapping from that model state to views. Then your tests of the model layer are effectively tests of the resulting UI as well :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

<h4 id="is-it-possible-enumerate-a-navigationpath-or-replace-certain-elements">Is it possible enumerate a NavigationPath or replace certain elements?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
It’s not currently possible to enumerate a <code>NavigationPath</code>. Because it’s type-erased, the elements could only be exposed as <code>any Hashable</code> so  aren’t directly useful.</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Generally, if the set of things that can be added to a path form a closed set, which would be the case if you can usefully enumerate it, I’d recommend wrapping your presented values in an enum with associated types.</p>
<p>|U03J1UFC1QB|:
I’m wondering if having a mutable collection of enum values might be generally more useful than using a NavigationPath.</p>
<p>|U03J1UFC1QB|:
Snap!</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Then use an array of that enum instead of NavigationPath.</p>
<p>|U03J1UFC1QB|:
Sounds like that could work better and might fit nicely with some form of Coordinator-esque style pattern.</p>

Dynamic properties are fully composable, so any other dynamic properties you use inside of their declarations will be picked up on and invalidated properly.

SwiftUI doesn’t have much in the way of automatic support for that, I’m afraid. I’d love a Feedback with details of your specific use case.</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
We did expose public API for <code>disclosureGroupStyle</code> this year, which might be worth investigating.</p>
<p>|U03J4EZ3ZHA|:
The use case would be a sidebar that the user can organize on their own.</p>
<p>I was thinking this could be a normal list, but there a limits with cross-section item moves that I end up tripping over. </p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Makes sense. With the current API, I’d use a view model that vends the items as if they are a flat array, then style the items based on their apparent depth. That would let you use <code>onMove</code> or the awesome new editing support on <code>List</code> to update your view model.</p>
<p>|U03J4EZ3ZHA|:
Yeah, I think biggest trick there is figuring out that “offset 20” is actually “offset 2 of parent 4” or something like that.</p>

<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Hi - this is a great question! While we do not currently have a high-level concept in SwiftUI for this type of flow, it may be possible to combine the  new <code>Window</code> scene together with the new <code>OpenDocumentAction</code> and <code>NewDocumentAction</code> to create it. You would need to define the <code>Window</code> as the primary (first) scene in your app, however.

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
There's a Swift Charts Q&amp;A at 11am PT on Thu. Please ask there!</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
In the meantime, you can always try drawing an additional mark for the highlight.</p>
<p>|U03HL05BUJG|:
Its possible to modify the <code>.foregroundStyle</code> to have a different color per X position, it depends on what kind of highlight you want to call out. It might be possible to do an annotation as well but the charts team will be the experts!</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
The Build a Productivity App for Apple Watch talk, coming tomorrow, has an example of exactly that!</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10133">https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10133</a></p>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
You can use <code>PointMark</code> (possibly with annotations) to highlight values on a line, such as:</p>
<pre><code>Chart {
    // Create the line.
    ForEach(data) {
        LineMark(
            x: .value(&quot;X&quot;, $0.x),
            y: .value(&quot;Y&quot;, $0.y)
        )
    }
    // Highlight a point.
    PointMark(
        x: .value(&quot;Highlight X&quot;, 10),
        y: .value(&quot;Highlight Y&quot;, 50)
    )
    .foregroundStyle(highlightColor)
    // You can also add textual annotations to the point:
    .annotation(position: .top) {
        Text(&quot;Highlight&quot;)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>|U03JE01BA4D|:
I am sorry for not being clear. What I want is having a vertical line when I tap on a specific X position so that all datapoints on that X position are highlighted.</p>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
You would decompose the problem into 1) using a chart proxy to get the x position for a tap and 2) highlighting the data points at that x. The lollipop tooltip we have in the Swift Charts sample app may be a starting point to look at.</p>

<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
Hi Harry, this API is not available. However, we'd be interested in learning more about your use case here. Could you please explain your scenario and the expected behavior in <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant">https://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant</a> for the SwiftUI team to consider for a future release?</p>
<p>|U03JELT4UC9|:
Will do
One primary use is to determine if the drag started from the same app (either same view or from another scene)
The other reason is to use that to pass data (where NSItemProvider works but is async and may be out of order)</p>
<p>|U03J23B9J58|:
This could be semi-related, but at the moment if a drag begins and ends without any movement (i.e. you let your finger go immediately after the drag was activated) there’s no communication back to the app. So, for example, if the drag trigger activates a specific UI state, then when the drag is released, it won’t be de-activated because it considers the drag to still be (incorrectly) active.</p>
<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
Yes, I think both of these use cases should be captured as feedback. Providing context like this is very helpful in prioritizing new features. Thank you, both</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
You can pass any kind of information you like to an adopter of <code>Layout</code>.  So that "certain width" could be passed to the instance of the <code>Layout</code> itself. And the layout priority can be provided via the subviews proxy of <code>Layout</code>.</p>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
In the swiftinterface file there is discussion of this:</p>
<pre><code>/// Views have layout values that you set with view modifiers.
/// Layout containers can choose to condition their behavior accordingly.
/// For example, a built-in ``HStack`` allocates space to its subviews based
/// in part on the priorities that you set with the ``View/layoutPriority(_:)``
/// view modifier. Your layout container accesses this value for a subview by
/// reading the proxy's ``LayoutSubview/priority`` property.
</code></pre>
<p>|U03HELSV45B|:
You can see the rendered version of that text in the docs under the heading “Access Layout Values”: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/layout">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/layout</a></p>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
Thinking about this more....</p>
<p>Reasoning about this in terms of autolayout might make things tricker than they need to be, especially for 2 views.  For instance you could instead use a custom <code>LayoutValueKey</code> to say that View A should take 70% of the proposed size, and View B should take 30%.</p>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
Rough sample code:</p>
<pre><code>MyCustomLayout(widthThreshold: 300.0) {
    viewA.oversizedWidthPercentage(0.7)
    viewB.oversizedWidthPercentage(0.3)
}
</code></pre>
<p>|U03JBRYGWEP|:
i was thinking something more like breaking "constraints" due to certain conditions based (if possible)</p>

Is there something similar for simple Views? E.g. a view which calculates its required height based on the available width. What's the best practice to solve something like this?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
You’re definitely correct that the state management dynamic properties do is usually handled using their own sub-dynamic properties, and custom logic! The update method is called directly before the corresponding view’s <code>body</code> is called, and is more a place for any logic that needs to happen before body runs to occur.</p>
<p>|U03JEMDRZDX|:
So, for things that I assume are not stateful in nature, just derivates of the state?</p>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
That tends to be the case. That said, there may be some examples of property wrappers that use information about when the view is rendered to drive stateful systems. When debugging, I’ll sometimes use a <code>DynamicProperty</code> with an <code>Int</code> <code>wrappedValue</code> that increments whenever the surrounding view’s body is drawn, for example :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03JEMDRZDX|:
That’s a neat trick! Thanks for sharing and for the answer!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
The data flow primitives we provide in SwiftUI were designed to be agnostic to the way you design your model. Think of them less as parts of a specific design pattern and more as tools to allow you to hook your model (however you think it would be best designed) into SwiftUI.</p>
<p>If you want more information on this, I recommend you check out the fantastic talk by my colleagues, Raj, and Luca: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10040/|Data Essentials in SwiftUI">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10040/|Data Essentials in SwiftUI</a></p>
<p>|U03J9T1R5M4|:
Thanks for the response, that’s an excellent way of putting it. It’s definitely difficult explaining this to an Android developer who relies on older “architecture” or design patterns. This will probably help a lot. I’m not sure if this would be good to add here, but i created some SwiftUI pattern i think could be beneficial for my team and it leverages wrappers. The thing is, it’s difficult convincing others that it could work since this is how SwiftUI handles data flow. I will definitely check out this video though, this is what i was envisioning too, maybe you can provide some feedback if any:</p>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
Providing feedback on specific designs is hard to do in this venue, but definitely sign up for a lab! They tend to do better for long-form discussions / questions.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
For example, looking at ways to replace this code:</p>
<pre><code>UIApplication.shared
       .sendAction(#selector(UIResponder.resignFirstResponder),
                        to: nil, from: nil, for: nil)

// as an action to perform on a view:

extension View {
    func resignFocus() {
        UIApplication.shared.sendAction(...)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>|U03J7BPBLE4|:
You can do this with the Focus State API: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/focusstate">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/focusstate</a></p>
<p>You want to bind a focus state property to your text field using <code>View.focused(_:equals:)</code>, and then set the binding's value to <code>nil</code>/<code>false</code> from your button action as a way to programmatically resign focus and dismiss the keyboard when the bound text field has focus.</p>
<p>Making the action available to distant views is a matter of arranging your app's data flow appropriately. There's no single answer, but for example, you could declare your focus state property on your scene's root view and pass a reset action down to any descendant views that need it. Or if the action is created by a leaf view, you can use the preferences system to make the action available to ancestors.</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
Preferences is an interesting idea. Trying to make the focusstate “globally accessible” was challenging. I’ll give these suggestions a shot! Thanks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7BQQNPJ|:
We’d generally recommend resolving it right away and storing the view</p>
<p>|U03JEMDRZDX|:
Thank you, much appreciated!</p>
<p>|U03H318N6T1|:
Storing the view will have better performance than storing a closure (potentially avoiding allocations).</p>
<p>Of course, if you need to dynamically resolve a view from a closure (such as if it takes parameters), then storing the closure is also fine!</p>
<p>|U03JLPYRCFK|:
Is this the same for Layout? The example code for AnyLayout shows creating a layout in the body instead of in the View.</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
You can now (last year?) also declare the viewbuilder as just a property. In SwiftUI 1, you had to manually implement the init, but no longer needed. Best (IMHO) to use synthesized init when you can.</p>
<pre><code>struct MyView&amp;lt;Content: View&amp;gt;: View {

    @ViewBuilder var content: Content

}
</code></pre>
<p>(I believe is the correct code, coding from memory)</p>
<p>|U03H318N6T1|:
Yes you can attach <code>@ViewBuilder</code> to properties!</p>
<p>You can actually support it on both view and closure properties, depending on whichever you need:</p>
<pre><code>struct MyView&amp;lt;Content: View&amp;gt;: View {

  @ViewBuilder var content: Content

  // or

  @ViewBuilder var content: (Int) -&amp;gt; Content

}
</code></pre>
<p>|U03H318N6T1|:
&gt; Is this the same for Layout? The example code for AnyLayout shows creating a layout in the body instead of in the View.
Apologies, not sure I fully understand the question. Just in case: creating views in <code>body</code> is fine, we’re specifically talking about <em>stored properties</em>, and storing views versus closures for creating views.</p>
<p>|U03JCHKCDB4|:
Sorry not sure if this is not the right place to ask this.
When a view uses <code>ScrollViewReader</code> and the parent view’s state changes, the the child view gets reloaded and the scroll position in the child view changes. This happens only when <code>scroll(to:)</code> has been executed. I have filed a feedback <code>FB10037533</code></p>
<p>|U03HMBPKU0P|:
Talking about this, can you confirm it’s best for performance to have the @ViewBuilder be a computed (lazy ?) var than a function in my View struct whenever possible?</p>
<p>|U03JRP2D5NC|:
BTW there is a 3rd-party article explains why the view is preferable than the closure <a href="https://rensbr.eu/blog/swiftui-escaping-closures/">https://rensbr.eu/blog/swiftui-escaping-closures/</a> (If you don’t mind posting 3rd-party article)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
You may be able to use the <code>alignmentGuide</code> modifier to define how an alignment guide for a view will resolve</p>
<p>|U03JLRZJHQR|:
My goal is to get the CGFloat value from the container view for its own alignment guides in the placeSubviews function. (Specifically, to do a layout similar to VStack where the children align in the left middle or right)</p>
<p>|U03HELSV45B|:
Well, you get the bounds of the region that you are laying out inside of, so you can know the midpoint in each dimension, for example</p>
<p>|U03HELSV45B|:
You can also set explicit alignment guides for the layout container by implementing either or both of the explicit alignment methods:

Ok, thank you. I also thought maybe using the largest subviews’ guides as the base, then it would work with custom AlignmentIDs</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HELSV45B|:
If you call the method more than once for a subview, the last call takes precedence. If you don’t call this method for a subview, the subview appears at the center of its layout container and uses the layout container’s size proposal.</p>
<p>|U03JLPYRCFK|:
I found this function a bit strange as I was expecting it to return an array of placements instead of running a place function. Is it more efficient the way it’s set currently set up?</p>
<p>|U03JLPYRCFK|:
Actually, one more follow-up. Is there a way to simply not place a view or have it hidden? Imagine a coverflow style view where you only want to show a small set of subviews.</p>
<p>|U03HELSV45B|:
You interact with the subviews from within the layout protocol via the subview proxies that you get as input. This lets you do things like propose a size or place the view, but not perform arbitrary operations on the view, or apply arbitrary modifiers. If there’s something specific that you’d like to do but can’t, please do file a feedback with your use case.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7PE3SM|:
hi, the framework makes no guarantees on the specific timeframes on when these methods are called, but you <em>can</em> be sure that onAppear will <em>always</em> be called before the view is visible to the user and onDisappear will <em>never</em> be called while the view is on screen.</p>
<p>|U03HW7PE3SM|:
We have recently updated the documentation for these methods online to clarify these details; see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/AnyView/onAppear(perform:)">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/AnyView/onAppear(perform:)</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/AnyView/onDisappear(perform:)">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/AnyView/onDisappear(perform:)</a></p>
<p>|U03HW7PE3SM|:
in terms of a comparison to UIKit, there is not a direct parallel. The UIKit methods are invoked specifically around when views become visible/not visible to the user, whereas the SwiftUI calls are tied more to when the views are constructed/torn down, rather than visually presented.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7BQQNPJ|:
The right way to structure your state varies by app.</p>
<p>I’m interested in understanding your specific use case. Are you asking this when using <code>@State</code> or <code>ObservableObject</code>?</p>
<p>|U03J1TN6WBD|:
Both actually. My use case involves a ViewModel which has @Published variables, together with diff element which is kind of a half drawer that involves @State for it's open/closed state.</p>
<p>|U03J7BQQNPJ|:
For State, I would generally recommend defining it at the level where you are going to use it.</p>
<p>For your ViewModel it could be useful to break your model into multiple <code>ObservableObject</code> that are specific to a specific functionality (like a cell, or a single screen).
But I would avoid prematurely breaking you model into very small pieces.</p>
<p>SwiftUI does diff your view and will only re-render if it detects that something has changed.</p>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
• Everything suggested in the Demystify SwiftUI Session from a year or two back is definitely useful
• Keeping <code>Identifier</code>s separate from values is recommended generally (but not a hard and fast rule), especially in Navigation APIs.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7NMP6D|:
Good question! Across all platforms, we’d recommend comparing your needs to what SwiftUI provides (so no hard rules/recommendations) — and keeping in mind that you can adopt SwiftUI incrementally.</p>
<p>Within Apple’s own apps on macOS, we’re ourselves using the full spectrum of approaches. From just a specific view/views in an app, e.g. in Mail, iWork, Keychain Access; to an entire portion of the UI or a new feature, e.g. in Notes, Photos, Xcode; and all the way to the majority of an application, e.g. Control Center, Font Book, System Settings.</p>
<p>But in the end, I’d recommend starting with a part you’re comfortable with and building up from there! You should look at SwiftUI as another tool in your toolset in enabling you to build the best apps you can.</p>

<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
Hi Bardia, I'd expect that to work, especially because text transitions work well when the text is changing layouts (multiple lines/alignments). We realize that it can be a little tricky to know how far exactly you can push those beautiful text transitions. Have you tried this out and seen otherwise?</p>

Ah I can reply now :slightly_smiling_face: Sorry for the late response (it was very late in London last night). Yep, I’ve tried and have logged FB9156668 including code/clip.</p>
<p>Basically it animates perfectly back-and-forth when both text are visible on a single line.</p>
<p>However, when the one text goes over two lines – due to larger text size for example – and me allowing it to (via fixedSize(vertical: true)), this causes the animation in either direction to not be fluid (best demonstrated in the video).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Hi - you can certainly define a SwiftUI <code>App</code> with only a <code>MenuBarExtra</code> <code>Scene</code>. If your app should not show a Dock icon, that will require some changes to the <code>Info.plist</code> file, which should be noted in the documentation for <code>MenuBarExtra</code></p>
<p>|U03HELSV45B|:
See <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/menubarextra">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/menubarextra</a></p>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Posting that bit of documentation here as well:
&gt; For apps that only show in the menu bar, a common behavior is for the app to not display its icon in either the Dock or the application switcher. To enable this behavior, set the <code>LSUIElement</code> flag in your app’s <code>Info.plist</code> file to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>|U03HMDG985D|:
Good to know. So it sounds like I would want to create a separate, <code>MenuBarExtra</code>-only app.</p>
<p>Can I bundle that with my Mac app on the App Store?</p>
<p>|U03HMDG985D|:
(Wrong lounge, I know…)</p>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Hmm, I'm afraid I do not know the answer to that App Store question.</p>
<p>|U03HMDG985D|:
That’s alright. I had to ask anyway.</p>
<p>|U03HMDG985D|:
Do MenuBarExtra’s support other SwiftUI features, like keyboard shortcuts, so I could invoke it or an action it has via a (global?) shortcut?</p>

<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
Check out the <em>SwiftUI Cookbook for Navigation</em> session and the <em>What's New in SwiftUI</em> session for 2 examples of deep links</p>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
They are indeed possible, and we think they work pretty well :wink: Of course, there's a lot of routing to consider with any app — for instance if your deep link is behind some authentication token, you'll need to do the extra work there.</p>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
The general idea is that a deep link is certain destinations presented — in order — on a navigation stack, and with this years' new APIs you can have full control over what is on the navigation stack.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Thanks for the question!</p>
<p>One of the strengths of SwiftUI as a framework is that it works well with a variety of architectures.</p>
<p>We might be opinionated about API design :slightly_smiling_face:, but we want you to have the flexibility to design the data model that works best for your app.</p>
<p>The particular data model of any individual app depends on the domain of that app. For example, a car rental app might have a very different architecture from a news reader app.</p>
<p>|U03J4DB3NAK|:
Can you recommend a website that provides various examples of architecture using SwiftUI?</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
One challenge I’ve come across is that the coordinator pattern doesn’t translate well to SwiftUI. You will often have <code>NavigationLink</code>s in your views, whereas the coordinator pattern wants to separate that logic from the view itself.</p>
<p>But this years <code>NavigationStack</code> is going to make new coordinator-like patterns <em>much</em> easier to implement. I’m curious to experiment with that this week.</p>

<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
While <code>TimelineView</code> can be used to update views at a specific point in time, it isn’t designed specifically for cross-device synchronization.

I'm just not sure of any other way to do this currently for an app view I want to do. </p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
You might experiment with using the layout values to route information.</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
You could also experiment with using Canvas to do the drawing, though that’s a low-level approach that wouldn’t give you accessibility out of the box. Check out the accessibilityRepresentation modifier for that.</p>
<p>|U03J4EJ0CVA|:
Any ideas on how to “route”?</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Ultimately, that’s “just” math. There are a few open source frameworks for diagram drawing. You might be able to see what algorithms they are using.</p>
<p>|U03HVCNN2DU|:
Maybe alternate row of boxes &amp; row of custom Paths? Use the layout info from the boxes to feed the custom Paths.</p>

Flow layouts are great for it. There’s a good example in the Food Truck sample app.</p>

Whatever you can imagine :upside_down_face:</p>
<p>In the State of the Union we mentioned Flow and Radial layouts as good examples</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
A custom layout can be a good fit if there's something super custom in your app</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
I am thinking of a dynamic layout case for seating order around tables. User could create a new Table, specify if the table is rectangular, oval or circular, and specify the number of guests at each side. We could then get a layout for the table as specified, and the user can fill in the guests. In code terms, this could mean that the specific layout should be created dynamically. Would something like this be possible?</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
It's an even better fit for building a generic layout container that you can reuse across your app (like Flow referenced above)</p>

LayoutValueKey allows you to pass information from your view hierarchy along to layout, but please note that layout can't use this information to make style changes to the view, only to determine its layout.</p>

This is not really related to the Layouts video we just watched, but rather a question that I had a while ago. The video was really clear. Thanks for the amazing explanations!  Moving on to the question, dan we use SwiftUI to create a numeric text field? I was looking for something that allows typing Int numbers.   In my case, I had to work to with 4 digit numbers, and a stepper wasn't the best choice. Instead, I went for a TextField that checks if it can convert the input string to an Int when a button is clicked. Is there a better way to achieve this?</h4>

<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
Yes! Gauge is usable outside of the Lock Screen, and also has a whole host of new styles! I would take a look at the linearCapacity, accessoryLinearCapacity, and accessoryCircularCapacity styles. Please note though that gauge styles prefixed with “accessory” are really intended to appear in contexts like the Lock Screen / widgets, or some similar design context within your app proper, so please give careful consideration to where you use them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7QCHK3|:
If you’d like search suggestions to be rendered inline your results, you should consider them as part of your results and not provide any suggestion views to the searchable modifier.</p>
<p>Note though that in iOS 16.0, for a regular width size class, a search bar that is displayed in the trailing navigation bar will display suggestions in a menu rather than over the main content like on macOS. Take a look at the SearchSuggestionsPlacement type and searchSuggestions(_:in:) modifier for customizing your UI around this behavior.</p>

I'm wondering if it's possible to re-implement it in Layout, but I'm unclear about if it's possible to get at the anchor preference frame data.)</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
A layout is only able to position its direct subviews.</p>
<p>It can  be superior to GeometryReader because it's able to do that while also computing a sizeThatFits.</p>
<p>If you're trying to arrange things that are crossing parent-child boundaries, though, anchor preferences will likely still be necessary.</p>
<p>|U03J1UAEU4B|:
A Layout that contained and positioned all of my card subviews would therefore know their positions - and I imagine I could put those in the cache. I guess I'm wondering if there's a way my layout can provide that information out to my model layer when a drag gesture finishes?</p>
<p>|U03J1UAEU4B|:
More generally - can a Layout relay its layout information externally in some way? Or is that not possible?</p>

I believe it applies to the current view, so you can change the behavior at different levels of the hierarchy.</p>

There’s also <code>toolbarColorScheme</code> if you need to control the text appearance.</p>

This is a topic that deserves its own WWDC :joy: I really, really recommend Paul Hudson's videos on this. He helped me a lot with understanding the relationships between SwiftUI and Core Data.

Great question. There were no additions to SwiftUI in regards to Core Data. However, we do have our <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/loading_and_displaying_a_large_data_feed|CoreData ">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/loading_and_displaying_a_large_data_feed|CoreData </a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/loading_and_displaying_a_large_data_feed|Earthquakes">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/loading_and_displaying_a_large_data_feed|Earthquakes</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/loading_and_displaying_a_large_data_feed| sample app">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/loading_and_displaying_a_large_data_feed| sample app</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/apple/repositories?q=sample-cloudkit&amp;type=all&amp;language=&amp;sort=|CloudKit sample apps">https://github.com/orgs/apple/repositories?q=sample-cloudkit&amp;type=all&amp;language=&amp;sort=|CloudKit sample apps</a> all showing best practices with SwiftUI and background contexts.</p>

The former performs batch inserts and merges changes on a background thread, then publishes the changes to SwiftUI on the main thread.</p>

One place I am struggling with right now is providing the ability to edit an entity with the idea of "cancel" and "save".</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
&lt;@U03HELS8GHK&gt; Thank you for sharing Earthquakes example, I’ll definitely check it out. Any chance I can get your attention to FB8545866 pretty please? For a very simple Core Data + List implementation, app crashes whenever an item is deleted from the List. It would be awesome if there was a guideline around more complex implementations.</p>
<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
&gt; One place I am struggling with right now is providing the ability to edit an entity with the idea of "cancel" and "save".
This notion of edit propagation is described in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/working-with-ui-controls|Landmarks app">https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/working-with-ui-controls|Landmarks app</a> in the SwiftUI Tutorials</p>
<p>|U03J21ZD15Y|:
My current plan is to do MVVM by using classes with Value Semantics instead of actual value types but I've just started down that path.</p>
<p>|U03J21ZD15Y|:
Thanks for all the pointers!</p>
<p>|U03J20KFJG3|:
&lt;@U03HELS8GHK&gt; I'm not sure we can compare the Landmark app based on Struct with an app using Core Data with objects in contexts. How can we use child contexts with SwiftUI? What would be the best approach to edit entities in a child context?</p>
<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
Great follow-up question, Axel. We don't have a sample today detailing this exact scenario, so you'll have to apply the same concepts from the Landmarks app to the merge flow shown in Earthquakes. I'd suggest requesting more samples via Feedback Assistant, though, so we can consider more opportunities to improve our learning resources.</p>
<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
To clarify, the Earthquakes sample uses private contexts to perform its batch inserts and merges the changes into the main context. So, that sample is a great place to start.</p>
<p>|U03J20KFJG3|:
Thanks. I explored a lot these sample projects and took some inspiration. But they don't really cover UI edits made by a user. I'll fill some FB.</p>

I've looked into some of the WindowGroup API, but it doesn't seem like it supports what I'm looking for. Essentially, I have N views of various sizes that can either be docked into a main window, or float above it. I'm running in to issues like sharing state between the docked version and the windowed one, as there seems to be a difference in the relationship between how a standard SwiftUI update bindings works for windows or views. Given that, what would be some ways that I could go about this method of 'docking / undocking' SwiftUI views, and keeping their state in tact?  Thank you!</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Hi - this is really interesting! I'm not really sure we have any API that entirely fits your concept here, but I'd love to learn more. Can you speak to how you are accomplishing this at the moment? Also a feedback for this with any details you provide would be great!</p>
<p>|U03JRPTDF6U|:
Absolutely! I’m doing this right now in my project at <a href="http://github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat|github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat">http://github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat|github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat</a>.</p>
<p>Posting this now to respond to you, and will follow up real quick with a screenshot and a code snippet.</p>
<p>|U03JRPTDF6U|:
The key classes are all here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat/tree/4dbe4a8f93f5dafd56752433df917352076da664/Interop/Views/FloatableView">https://github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat/tree/4dbe4a8f93f5dafd56752433df917352076da664/Interop/Views/FloatableView</a></p>
<p>|U03JRPTDF6U|:
<code>FloatableView</code> swift basically takes some bindings to an enumerable state type (floating, docked), and then either presents the view directly as a child, or acts as an intermediary ‘adapter’ between the parent hosting view and a floating window. The window itself ends up as a separate instance of the view, but seems to be more or less functional since it still can participate in shared state updates.</p>
<p>The other classes, window delegate and the extensions, help construct and manage the window lifecycle a bit.</p>
<p>|U03JRPTDF6U|:
The two things that are tricky are that the view is still technically bound to an <code>EmptyView</code> that lets the state remain active, and the window is its own ‘thing’. It seems like there would be a way to sever that connection between the root view that owns the docked version of the view and the window (which is why I was really trying to consider WindowGroups), but I just couldn’t crack this one.</p>
<p>|U03JRPTDF6U|:
And hey, is that feedback from the dev-feedback-app? If so, I’d be happy to share this and our discussion with it.</p>
<p>And since I was rude and forgot, <em>thank you</em> for taking your time to talk and take a look!</p>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Yep, there should be an app called Feedback Assistant that you can use. Any info you can put in there, like what you have above would certainly be useful.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7BQQNPJ|:
In general we discourage to do any expensive work in the init of a view. SwiftUI expects the creation of views to be cheap.
We recommend doing any side effect or data loading with either <code>.task</code> or <code>.onAppear</code>.</p>
<p>|U03KJSLF04Q|:
Even <code>.onAppear</code>  ran last time I tried. Currently I am using this workaround from StackOverflow:</p>
<pre><code>public struct NavigationLazyView&amp;lt;Content: View&amp;gt;: View {
    public let build: () -&amp;gt; Content
    public init(_ build: @autoclosure @escaping () -&amp;gt; Content) {
        self.build = build
    }
    public var body: Content { build() }
}
</code></pre>
<p>|U03KJSLF04Q|:
Starting loading of data in <code>onAppear</code>  causes some time the user has to wait for the heart rate graph. Also not super desireable.</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Check out the new <code>NavigationStack</code>. Inside that <code>NavigationLink</code>s can present values instead of views. The resulting view can then do work in <code>onAppear</code> or using <code>task</code>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HL05BUJG|:
You want to always add a <code>UIHostingController</code> as a <code>childViewController</code>.</p>
<pre><code>// Add the hosting controller as a child view controller
self.addChild(hostingController)
self.view.addSubview(hostingController.view)
hostingController.didMove(toParent: self)
</code></pre>
<p>without the view controller relationship things that depend on the <code>UIViewController</code> hierarchy won’t work. Such as <code>UIViewControllerRepresentable</code></p>
<p>|U03HL05BUJG|:
There are a few other types as well that depend on this relationship in their underlying representations so its best practice to add the parent/child relationship.</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
I am building a design system implementation where I’m providing reusable components that other teams can simply build their features. I usually start with SwiftUI but this view controller relationship makes things very hard at times, especially if the view in question is complex. I believe there is <code>NSHostingView</code> on the Mac, I wish we had the same on iOS. For the time being, given the requirement, is there any recommendation to fulfill this requirement? For example, can we even use window’s <code>rootViewController</code> as a parent or is there a better way?</p>
<p>|U03HL05BUJG|:
yes the AppKit underlying infrastructure makes <code>NSHostingView</code> work while UIKit is not able to do so due to the hierarchy requirements.
It depends on exactly what you are trying to build, but potentially you could make a reusable view controller that your teams can use instead depending on where the complexity is at. Parenting at the <code>rootViewController</code>  would have issues with any navigation calls you might try to make in SwiftUI.</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
Ah got it, thanks for clarifying. It is a little bit overhead to ask the teams to add a child view controller just for a button from the design system. :sweat_smile: And it’s extra challenging if they are adding it to a <code>UIView</code> subclass down in the view hierarchy where they don’t have access to any view controller for example.</p>

<p>|U03J7BP0URW|:
The GraphicsContext.ResolvedText type also has <code>firstBaseline</code> (and <code>lastBaseline</code>) methods. So you can do something like:</p>
<pre><code>let baseline = context.resolve(myText).firstBaseline(in: size)

Check out the new context menu API that accepts a <code>forSelectionType</code> parameter. This passes the value of the selection into the modifier for you to act on.</p>
<pre><code>List(selection: $selection) {

.contextMenu(forSelectionType: MySelection.self) { selection in

Hi, David! I was a teacher before I went full-time software engineer.</p>
<p>What I shared in the talk and in the Copy Code associated with it should work.

Hi Curt, yes, we corresponded when you were a teacher and then spent your sabbatical at OmniGroup. I’ve been tempted by some Apple positions, but can’t relocate right now. Hmm. I tried running it in simulator. I select Apple Pie, select Fruit Pie Filling, press Shift-Cmd-H. Press the stop button in Xcode, and then relaunch the app and it starts at the initial Categories screen. Am I not testing it correctly?</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Ah! Yeah, Xcode kills background storage unless you hold it “just right”.</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
The pattern when working with Xcode, is to (1) background the app in the simulator or on device, (2) wait 10 seconds for the system to do its backgrounding work, (3) kill the app using the Stop button in Xcode.</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Then when you run the app again, it should use the saved value.</p>
<p>|U03JV21RJ7K|:
Ah, I waited a few seconds, but probably not 10. Also, I did the next best thing to joining Apple myself - one of my students is now there (Jeremy who did the AV Foundation “Creating a more responsive media app” talk this year.</p>

Hmm, I waited more than 10 seconds and still doesn’t work. After navigating, I press Shift-Cmd-H to return to home screen, wait 15 seconds, press stop in Xcode, and then relaunch from Simulator and still starts over with the Category list. If I use the Run button in Xcode, it starts over at the “Choose your navigation experience”? I’m using an iPhone simulator (iPhone 13) not an iPad simulator if that makes ay difference.</p>

So while UIKit would have an outlet for multiple labels, in SwiftUI I'd have a binding state for each label. Is that typically the correct pattern?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
That seems like a totally reasonable approach! Generally, when you have some value that you want to change in SwiftUI, you want to make sure that there’s a clear source of truth for that value. That source of truth can either be <code>@State</code>, or a property within an <code>ObservableObject</code>.</p>
<p>When you have a fixed number of controls, having a separate piece of state backing each of those controls is completely reasonable.</p>
<p>That said, the sources of truth you provide for your state should mirror your UI, so if you dynamically generate your labels from an array of data, you might then want to have an array of data as the source of truth state for your ui components. If you see that your sources of truth for your data mirror the structure of your UI, you’re probably on the right track :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HB07LNLW|:
Hi Peter,
We strongly recommend separating semantic controls and styles as it provides a lot more flexibility.
For example, using the button style modifier will apply to the whole hierarchy, so if you decide you want specific parts of your app to use a different button style, you can just apply it to that specific hierarchy without changing the control itself.</p>
<p>With this approach you also get multi-platform behaviors for free.</p>
<p>|U03J2RRKF9U|:
My app’s design uses kerning on most of its buttons, but I can’t put that inside of my <code>ButtonStyle</code> because kerning is only available on <code>Text</code>, which <code>ButtonStyleConfiguration.Label</code> is not. I have a feedback open suggesting passing kerning through the environment (FB10020695).</p>
<p>In the meantime, do you have any suggestions on how to do this without having to separately use <code>.kerning()</code> on <em>every</em> button label?</p>

Around 23 minutes in, Curt uses the <code>task</code> modifier to run an async <code>for</code> loop over the model's <code>objectWillChange</code> publisher. In the loop, he then accesses an <code>@Published</code> property of the model. But a <code>@Published</code> property fires the <code>objectWillChange</code> property <em>before</em> it updates its <code>wrappedValue</code>. Doesn't that mean that when the code accesses <code>navModel.jsonData</code>, it will get the out-of-date model values? Or is there some async magic that guarantees the loop body will not run until later after the <code>objectWillChange</code> publisher has finished publishing and the <code>@Published</code> property has updated its <code>wrappedValue</code>?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Great question! Task schedules its body on the main actor, which is also where the view update happens. So objectWillChange enqueues the body of the for loop, but it’s enqueued behind the update of the data model.</p>

Inlining within Text is a nice benefit, but doesn't seem to work with custom multicolor symbols.</p>

<p>|U03J7BQQNPJ|:
On way to achieve that would be to have <code>onAppear</code> on a the individual views that the <code>List</code> is scrolling over and use that load in more data.</p>
<p>|U03JEMNCV18|:
What if you want the @State data to not grow as the user continues to page? Removing items from the array would offset the data and causes a jarring affect. </p>
<p>|U03JEMNCV18|:
I would be happy to submit a feature request for something that would allow me to build this, I’m just not sure what that would look like :dizzy_face:‍:dizzy:</p>

One way you can solve the problem is by keeping only identifiers in the <code>@State</code> so that the storage doesn’t grow too much, and load on the demand the actual data as view are coming on screen.</p>
<p>|U03J7BQQNPJ|:
A feedback would be great. You can simply describe your use case, what you are trying to achieve, and what kind of road block you are finding.</p>

I think ideally a way to detect when scrolling was finished for that TabView case would be great, because the onChange fires before it’s done scrolling</p>

<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Hi - thanks for the question! The cascading of windows is the default behavior for <code>WindowGroup</code>. We've also added a new <code>Scene</code> modifier - <code>defaultPosition</code>, which allows you to specify an initial position to use absent any previous state for the window. It takes a <code>UnitPoint</code>, so for example, it would be something like <code>defaultPosition(.topTrailing)</code>. Did you have some other behavior in mind? It'd be great to get more info, if so.</p>
<p>|U03K1JTADHN|:
It would be nice if I could position a new window just beside the already open window, e.g. to the right or left, depending on the available space.
The second window is a “compagnon” to the document, used for editing.</p>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Ah, I see. That makes sense given your use case there. Would you mind filing a feedback for an enhancement?</p>
<p>|U03K1JTADHN|:
So I have currently a <code>DocumentGroup</code> and a <code>WindowGroup</code> . The <code>WindowGroup</code>  instance would have a one-to-one relation to an open document.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7BP0URW|:
I usually default to <code>withAnimation</code> to set up animations based on when a change occurs. That way, whatever UI changes as a result will implicitly be animated.</p>
<p>In some cases, <code>View.animation</code> is useful when you have a certain view or view hierarchy you always want to change with an animation, regardless of what triggered it. A good example is the knob of a Switch: it should just always animate when it changes. (And make sure to pass an appropriate value, like <code>.animation(myAnimation, value: mySwitchValue)</code>, so that you only animate when the property you care about changes, and don’t accidentally animate too often.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7QCHK3|:
View’s body properties should be cheap and avoid any potentially expensive work. If there are things you need in your views body, its best to pre-compute that into a piece of state that you can pass your views.</p>
<p>Concretely, each frame has a hard deadline of generally 1/60s or 1/120s (depending on the refresh rate of the display) to render its content. Thats 8ms in the fastest case.</p>
<p>Thats for the entire screen to render its content though, not just your single view . So if any one view is taking more than a few ms to finish calling body, you’ll run into issues.</p>
<p>If you’re using Swift concurrency to move work off the main thread, consider watching this session: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110350/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110350/</a></p>
<p>This is all mostly related to scrolling performance. Other kinds of things like app launch or navigation pushes will typically take longer than multiple frames to render, but those situations have different expectations around frame deadlines.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
I think "hoisting" your state into an ancestor is your best bet here</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
As an aside, StateObject is more commonly used with model objects and you generally don't want to tie your model object's lifecycle to the view</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
In the case of a model object it might make sense for an ancestor model object to be maintaining references to these children model objects</p>
<p>|U03J4E9HNF6|:
&lt;@U03HELTEP9T&gt; What guarantees (if any) do we have about the longevity of a <code>StateObject</code>  property on a view? Should I try to move view-owned objects to the root App struct and inject them via EnvironmentObject?</p>
<p>|U03J4E9HNF6|:
I've already run into issues when changing device orientation, with my view hierarchy being torn down and recreated, losing any ephemeral state</p>
<p>|U03JX6SFGMS|:
Thanks! Yes in this scenario it's effectively a <code>State</code> , just incidentally modeled as a <code>StateObject</code> for other reasons — however we were finding that a <code>State</code> was getting reset as well back to the initial value as well in that same scenario. I assume that's expected as well?</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
&lt;@U03JX6SFGMS&gt; ya State would be expected to behave the same as StateObject here since the motivation is to limit memory growth by avoiding preserving state for an unbounded number of (offscreen) views</p>

<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
&lt;@U03JJQ3BMB7&gt; if you present a modal that has a confirmation action, the time will be hidden for you automatically, but otherwise, the time will always be there.</p>
<p>|U03JJQ3BMB7|:
Ok, thank you. Is it possible to do this with watch kit or is the time always shown? I'm just wondering if it's possible for me to recreate the keyboard menu in the phone app. Thank you!</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
I don't think so. Can you provide a screenshot of the menu on the phone that you are trying to mimic ?</p>
<p>|U03JJQ3BMB7|:
I am trying to make a calculator like app, and liked this layout from the phone app. I liked that the input pad keys were large and the entered numbers were in the status bar area</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
if you wanted to do that, you can do it in a modal sheet on watchOS, and you can provide a custom confirmation action as a button in the top right (like the delete button is), and you could provide a navigationTitle for content in the navigation bar, and then provide your own cancellationAction.</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
but the time will only hide if you actually put content in the navigation bar in that spot (via confirmation action placement toolbar)</p>

Is it safe (and encouraged) to use it, or do we have an alternative for it this year?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
This initializer is fine to use! In fact, the <code>ObservedObject(wrappedValue:)</code> initializer is invoked every time you construct an <code>ObservedObject</code> , even if you don’t explicitly write it yourself. When you write: <code>@ObservedObject var myObservedObject = myModel</code>, The Swift compiler converts that standard property wrapper syntax to a call that looks something like: <code>var _myObservedObject = ObservedObject(wrappedValue: myModel)</code>.</p>
<p>The controversy I think you’re referring to is using that initializer explicitly in the initializer for one of your views. Typically, we see people doing this to allow observed objects to be instantiated with specific information. That is also something which we think is fine to do. We recognize that the ergonomics of that case is not ideal (since you have to access the de-sugared property wrapped (in the example I gave, <code>_myObservedObject</code>), but it’s not at all harmful.</p>
<p>|U03JEMNCV18|:
What about the State initializer?</p>
<p>|U03J21ZD15Y|:
I think the confusion comes from this comment:</p>
<pre><code>/// Don't call this initializer directly. Instead, declare a property
/// with the ``State`` attribute, and provide an initial value:
</code></pre>
<p>|U03JCHKCDB4|:
I think <code>ObservedObject</code> also has a the initialiser <code>init(initialValue:)</code> is that preferred? The documentation doesn't mention any warning on this initialiser</p>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
The state initializer worries me a bit more. Not because it’s dangerous — it’s totally fine to use it yourself (as I mentioned, the normal syntax is just sugar for the fully spelled out case) — but because I can’t think of as many cases where you need that syntax for <code>@State</code> that aren’t dangerous.</p>
<p>Remember that <code>@State</code> is initialized once per lifetime of the whole view, <em>not</em> once per time a view’s initializer is called The views representation will be recreated on demand. That means that if you’re re-initializing the state every time the views init is called, you’re going to be clobbering your own state.</p>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
So that’s fine to do, but make sure that you’re only using it to set the initial value of a state, and that you’re not resetting your state depending on some initializer value.</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
&lt;@U03HKVDCL7N&gt; I believe same applies for <code>@Binding</code> and co. too?</p>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
Yup!</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
But for <code>@Binding</code> is it still harmful? Because source of truth is already on a parent view or somewhere up there?</p>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
Yeah, binding is also one of the cases that would sound alarm bells for me :warning:</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
Yeah fair, I’d still be cautious instead of making assumptions. Very nice tip though, thank you! :heart:</p>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
As a final note: regarding the “don’t call this initializer directly,” that’s mostly because as I mentioned, the cases where you “need” the underlying initializer (for <code>@State</code> and <code>@Binding</code> especially) are few and far between. Most of the time, you’d want to be using the standard property wrapper syntax, so we want to make sure people reading the docs look there first.</p>
<p>|U03JCHKCDB4|:
Is the concern because State variable's lifetime is outside the view's lifetime and initialising the State variable in the view's initialiser would keep creating a new State every time the view get's created?</p>
<p>|U03JEMNCV18|:
A recent use case where i would have used it was to pass in a value to a structs initializer, where that struct is also @State</p>
<p>|U03J21ZD15Y|:
Interesting.  The place I was using it was that I had a @FetchRequest that was based on a relationship to another object, so I was passing the object into init and then creating the fetch request based on it but was keeping that object as State.</p>
<p>Maybe I don't really need it to be State.</p>
<p>|U03J21ZD15Y|:
But maybe I shouldn't be creating the FetchRequest wrapper that way either?</p>
<p>|U03J20KFJG3|:
&lt;@U03J21ZD15Y&gt; I noticed in this case that the FetchRequest is init everytime the View is init. It does not behave like a State or StateObject where the property is tied to the lifetime of the View. So if I use a predicate or sortDescriptors updated by my subview, any update in the super view will reset the predicate/sortDescriptor. So these should be higher in the hierarchy, or based on a State.</p>
<p>|U03J1V9TNLT|:
&lt;@U03J20KFJG3&gt; &lt;@U03J21ZD15Y&gt; same thing here FB9956812. The FetchRequest struct mistakenly contains a var object that it inits every time which breaks SwiftUI's View identity matching so body is called every time. Really hope it is fixed in this beta cycle.</p>
<p>|U03J1V9TNLT|:
@Tom you can init a FetchRequest with params like this:</p>
<p><code>private var fetchRequest: FetchRequest&amp;lt;Appointment&amp;gt;</code>
    <code>private var appointments: FetchedResults&amp;lt;Appointment&amp;gt; {</code>
      <code>fetchRequest.wrappedValue</code>
    <code>}</code></p>
<pre><code>`init(date: Date, userID: String) {`
  `fetchRequest = FetchRequest(fetchRequest: Appointment.sortedFetchRequest(userId: userId, date: date))`
`}`
</code></pre>
<p>|U03J1V9TNLT|:
That wrappedValue trick is taken from the SectionedFetchRequest header comments.</p>

<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
I wouldn't consider it a bad practice</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
Be mindful when using plain <code>@Environment</code>, that if you're passing a struct, any change in value will invalidate any views reading that value from the environment</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
But if you're using <code>@EnvironmentObject</code> with a class that's effectively immutable that shouldn't be a problem</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
In an MVVM context, as <code>@Environment</code> and <code>@EnvironmentObject</code> values are passed into the view, how can we get them out of the view  to view model or any other helper type?</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
I wish I could use <code>@Environment</code> and <code>@EnvironmentObject</code> directly in the view model that is associated with the view for example</p>
<p>|U03JCHKCDB4|:
&lt;@U03HELTEP9T&gt; Is there any documentation on <code>Self._printChanges()</code> There was one instance where it said <code>@96 changed</code> I was not sure what it referred to. Does it refer to <code>@FetchRequest</code>?</p>
<p>|U03J1V9TNLT|:
&lt;@U03J1V9U7U3&gt; it's best to learn the View struct, it is actually a view model so you don't need another view model object in SwiftUI. If you do use them you'll just get the bugs typical of objects that SwiftUI has been designed to eliminate by its use of value type structs.</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
For simple use cases, yes, I agree. I do exactly this in my own app, but it doesn’t scale in a larger team working on a complex project. Especially as we’re adopting SwiftUI incrementally.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Hi - thanks for the question! With regards to your last part around the window controls (traffic lights) - SwiftUI will enable/disable these depending on the content of the scene. So, for example, a content view with a fixed size, will have the zoom and fullscreen button disabled. I'd also like to point out that on macOS Ventura, SwiftUI App lifecycle windows will be fully flexible by default (they can be resized to the maximum allowed by the screen). This can be opted out with a new <code>Scene</code> modifier - <code>windowResizability</code>. ie:</p>
<pre><code>WindowGroup {
}
.windowResizability(.contentSize)
</code></pre>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Enabling/disabling of full screen behavior is also related to the maximum size of the window's contents and how that relates to the screen size of the device</p>

I've been commonly using <code>StateObject(wrappedValue:)</code> to inject a stateobject into a detail view, but of course because wrappedValue is an autoclosure it doesn't get updates to the data value that may occur from the primary view. Passing the entire primary <code>StateObject</code> to the detail view can expose more data to the detail view than necessary. And creating and managing an <code>ObservableObject</code> owned by the primary <code>StateObject</code> can be boilerplatey and messy to manage. Any approaches I've overlooked, or tips on how to approach those tradeoffs?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
My intuition is that for a primary-detail setup, you would want the detail using <code>@ObservedObject</code> (or even <code>@Binding</code>) instead of <code>@StateObject</code>.</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
<code>@State</code> and <code>@StateObject</code> are defining a source of truth and lifetime for the state/model.</p>
<p>You want the lifetime of the state/model to live on beyond changing the selection in the primary.</p>
<p><code>@ObservedObject</code> will listen to changed in the model object and update the view without establishing a new source of truth.</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
&gt; I agree with &lt;@U03HELTEP9T&gt; and would like to add that I read somewhere that using (wrappedValue:) of State/StateObject in this way is discouraged. I will try to find the source. 
&gt; For your use case, I would use @StateObject in root, then @ObservedObject in detail, or @Binding in detail if you only want to expose something specific</p>
<p>|U03J1UAEU4B|:
Is the recommendation to inject the entire root StateObject into the detail as an ObservableObject, or for the root StateObject to create and maintain an ObservableObject which has the subset of relevant data, and inject that into the detail view?</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
the latter</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
Content view &lt;- State Object, holds the truth
Detail view &lt;- ObservedObject/Binding, refers to the truth</p>
<p>|U03J1UAEU4B|:
Thanks. That was my instinct too... I just don't want to manage it. :stuck_out_tongue: But it's probably a good choice.</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
If you wanna take the pro route :sunglasses: you will rely on protocols, and inject instances as needed using a custom property wrapper. The instances will be stored using a custom class (or save yourself trouble and use something like Resolver)</p>

<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Passing the binding or passing a navigation model as an environment object are both reasonable approaches with the API we have available today.</p>
<p>I hope we can make this more ergonomic. I’d love a Feedback with your use case!</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
I personally like the navigation model approach, since I can easily do other work when the navigation state changes without putting that code in my Views.</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
But either approach works fine.</p>
<p>|U03J21ZK802|:
So, a ViewModel (probably observableobject) that dictates navigation?</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Yeah. That works for the way I think about navigation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Hi - would you be able to provide some more detail here? I'd like to make sure I understand your question fully.</p>
<p>|U03HZ4XRUKF|:
If some value is stored not in a @State in the WindowGroup, for example, let uuid = UUID(). Will it stay the same in this specific case for the lifetime of the app. This is of course a bad practice, but I've seen it quite some time on the internet, and I would like to know if in this specific case, the value could be recreated or not as the app runs. This is more a theoretical question to try to get a better grasp around this specific value lifecycle.</p>
<p>|U03HZ4XRUKF|:
In other words, are WindowGroup susceptible of being recreated even if they have no stored dependencies, no @State, etc.</p>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
I see. I think for this, I would likely recommend storing this in an app-level model, and providing that value to the <code>WindowGroup</code></p>
<p>|U03HZ4XRUKF|:
But are there (private) system events that can recreate the WindowGroup?</p>
<p>|U03HZ4XRUKF|:
Mostly a theoretical question. I would always store something safely elsewhere, but I don't know if in this specific case, this is overzealous.</p>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
I don't think it's being overzealous, if that is what you are concerned about.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HELSV45B|:
You can add input parameters to your layout, and you can attach values to particular views using the <code>LayoutValueKey</code> protocol. To store data between calls into your layout, you can use the cache, but that’s only to avoid repeated calculations, and you should be prepared for the cache to go away at any time.</p>
<p>|U03JEG77FNF|:
Okay, so anything stateful should live in the parent view (and be passed as init args) or in a child view (and be read through a <code>LayoutValueKey</code>) ?</p>
<p>|U03HELSV45B|:
Yes</p>
<p>|U03JEG77FNF|:
Makes sense, thanks!</p>

Best way to debug a preview now would be to use Xcode's menu item Debug &gt; Attach to Process (or the Process by Pid or Name) and select/use the name of your app. Then update a string literal in that view and it should cause the View's body to get called and hit any breakpoints you've got in that code.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
Shapes don’t have the same data flow primitives as views do, so things like state, environment, etc. won’t work, but don’t despair! You can still get the results that I think you might want. Since you’ll eventually be showing your shapes somewhere in a SwiftUI <code>View</code>, you can hoist your data flow up to the SwiftUI <code>View</code> level, then pass down that information about state, environment, etc. down to the shapes.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7QCHK3|:
TextFields can be initialized with a new <code>axis</code> parameter. If you provide a .vertical axis, then platforms like iOS and macOS will wrap the text of the text field in a scrollable container instead of letting the text expand horizontally.</p>
<p>See one of its inits here: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textfield/init(_:text:axis:)-7n1bm">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textfield/init(_:text:axis:)-7n1bm</a></p>
<p>|U03JLRZJHQR|:
Awesome, thanks!</p>
<p>|U03HW7QCHK3|:
These text fields will also respect the line limit modifier. So specifying a <code>lineLimit(3)</code> will let the text field grow vertically up to 3 lines and then it will stop growing and scroll instead.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
If you want a visual effect like corner radius, opacity, or color to depend on your geometry, GeometryReader is the way to bridge between these two worlds</p>
<p>|U03J4E9HNF6|:
I particularly use <code>GeometryReader</code>  a ton to contextualize Gestures (e.g. to see whether the user has dragged all the way to the left or right of a control). Is there a different way?</p>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
Layout gives you a superior tool for encapsulating layout logic for re-use. And while using <code>GeometryReader</code> you can position children, the <code>GeometryReader</code> can't reflect back any custom sizing behavior.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons it can become unwieldy when used in complex layouts—because the <code>GeometryReader</code> becomes fully flexible.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
If the values you’re represented are never going to change, there’s no need to use <code>@State</code> or <code>@ObservedObject</code>. I highly recommend just making and using a standard <code>struct</code>.</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
&lt;@U03HKVDCL7N&gt; what about reference types in views? Would <code>let</code> suffice?</p>
<p>|U03J225KLCA|:
Should I ever be concerned that as the view gets thrown away and recreated my <code>UISelectionFeedbackGenerator</code>  instance (for example) will be continuously re-created as well?</p>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
Let <em>would not</em> suffice for reference types! A <code>let</code> binding for a reference type just says: “This will always point to the same instance of the object”. It <em>doesn’t</em> guarantee that that instance is immutable. If you can guarantee that your reference type is completely immutable, then you should be fine, but that can be a hard thing to ensure, so be cautious (and I would highly recommend using structs where you can)</p>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
Petar, I wouldn’t ever be concerned that your view gets thrown away and recreated. That’s by design. SwiftUI views aren’t linked to their actual UI representation, but rather are lightweight descriptions of views that can be recomputed quickly and easily. You should expect your views to be thrown away and recreated very frequently.</p>
<p>|U03J225KLCA|:
Thank you &lt;@U03HKVDCL7N&gt;, and just to hammer to point:
Don’t worry not just that the views are getting recreated, but also what instances get recreated with them.</p>

<p>|U03J7BQQNPJ|:
Ideally you should not use  <code>AnyView</code> and over the year <code>ViewBuilder</code> has improved enough that you should be able to eliminate most, if not all, its usage.</p>
<p>That said, yes you will still need to use <code>AnyView</code> because you need to actually instantiate that type, and not just use <code>View</code> as a type. <code>any View</code> is just defining an (existential container) box.</p>
<p>|U03HWEGHRKR|:
is it possible to use view builders as function params or property types without Generics?</p>
<p>we are using AnyView to present content. there are different types of content each represented by an enum with associated value. This forced us to use AnyView to have concrete types. What would be your suggestion to move away from AnyView in this use case?
Thank you :relaxed:</p>
<p>|U03J7BQQNPJ|:
If you have finite number of views you are displaying described by an enum could you switch over that enum in <code>body</code> of a view? <code>ViewBuilder</code> does support <code>switch</code> statements</p>
<p>|U03J2L8F1HB|:
I have similar use case. Sometimes I would like to not couple the view which other views it present, but instead use other <em>Flow/Factory</em> logic that shows whats needed depending on the business logic. It forces me to use <code>AnyView</code> . E.g.</p>
<pre><code>struct MainView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: MainViewModel
    var channelsViewFactory: (Int?) -&amp;gt; AnyView

    var body: some View {
        Text(&quot;ABC&quot;)
        channelsViewFactory(viewModel.selectedId)
    }
}
...
extension AppDependencies: MainViewFactory {
    func makeMainView() -&amp;gt; MainView {
        return MainView(
            channelsViewFactory: { id in
              if loggedIn {
                self.makeChannelsView(for: id)
              } else {
                self.makeSignInView()
              }
         }
     }
}
</code></pre>
<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
It really depends on your use case. But most of the time, if you're in the situation where you think you need <code>[AnyView]</code> or <code>[any View]</code>, what you should likely do is invert the view dependency flow and have <code>[AnyDataModel</code> or <code>[any DataModel]</code>  instead, then create your views based on the type of data provided at runtime.</p>
<p>|U03HELS8GHK|:
In Łukasz case, you could introduce generics into  <code>MainView</code> (e.g., <code>MainView&amp;lt;ChannelsView: View&amp;gt;: View</code>) and then create a container view above <code>MainView</code> to encapsulate the generic constraint(s).</p>

<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
please let me know if this works.</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
In my case it is custom strings. In my app, the user can see a List of mushroom species and search for a specific species using TextField. On iOS, I implemented another List that overlays the screen and shows results satisfying the user-typed value. The user can tap one of the results to complete the string. Not sure how to proceed in watchOS though</p>
<p>|U03HW7PE3SM|:
that sounds like a great use case. could you file a feedback with this info so we can pass it along?</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
yes, that^</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
And until then .. .</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
Can you create a modal, which has a list, and at the top of the list, you include a TextField, and below the textfield you include list items that are your autocompletions, and if they tap one of those, they get the short cut values, and if they tap the textfield they can enter the raw text?</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
&lt;@U03HW7PE3SM&gt; will do! &lt;@U03HHHXDL03&gt; not quite, since each mushroom species is unique, so the selection depends on the first several characters of a string. For example, typing "ama" will bring up mushrooms from the "Amanita" genus. Also, on watchOS, once the user taps on the textfield, the entire screen is covered by the modal, so there is no space for dynamic suggestions to come up while the user is typing.</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
Demo of how this works on iOS</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:

<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:

<p>|U03J21EKNSE|:
It would not help in this case, but getting a number keyboard for watchOS could help in other input fields!</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
thank you both &lt;@U03HHHXDL03&gt; and &lt;@U03HELSV45B&gt;! I will definitely take a look. But I'm not sure if searchable is the right solution, because I need to pass the user-typed value anyway, even if no results are found. For example, imagine the user just found a mushroom species that's not in my List! In this case, I allow the user to create a finding using whatever he/she typed (e.g. "Unknown mushroom", or "Some goop"). If the string is "", I also allow the finding to be saved as an "Unknown species". Is this something achievable using .searchable?</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
ya, you could have one of the search results always be the literal string that the user provided</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
So the first result would be the literal, and the rest of the results would be actual search results.</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
you might want to talk with the design lab folks about differentiating the literal from the actual results, but you should be able to achieve something like that</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
aha, interesting. And the matching results will somehow pop onto the screen as the user is typing?</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
the user will have to type the first few characters and click the done button in the top right, so not exactly.</p>
<p>|U03HHHXDL03|:
if searchable is helpful, great, but if you still feel like there's room for something to be better, please file a feedback request.</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:
ok, thank you. I will definitely take a look and explore. &lt;@U03HHHXDL03&gt; thank you for your patience and kind support! :heart: may you find only choice mushrooms on your hikes :mushroom:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HELTEP9T|:
The only other thing I can think of is to create a Button wrapper view that requires a Text be passed in as a parameter. Then attach <code>kerning</code> to the Text yourself and pass it to the underlying Button</p>
<p>|U03J2RRKF9U|:
Haha, was hoping to avoid that so we didn’t need to handle other permutations like buttons with text and an icon, etc :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>One other avenue I’ve been exploring is a custom Text view that accepts kerning through an Environment value applied by the ButtonStyle, though that has led to needing to reimplement multiple <code>init</code>s from Text. Doesn’t feel too great, either :sweat:</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>|U03HT7Z5NAK|:
&lt;@U03JELC631P&gt; the approach I normally take here Is to create a reusable view specifically for the button label rather than an entire button view. This results in code that composes nicely. I still use button styles for styling buttons more generally. </p>
<p>|U03J2RRKF9U|:
Thanks &lt;@U03HT7Z5NAK&gt;, that’s sort of the direction I was headed with the “custom Text view” idea—think like:</p>
<pre><code>Button(action: {}) {
  MyAppText(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>and then the ButtonStyle would set kerning in the environment for <code>MyAppText</code> to look at.</p>
<p>Still means our team needs to remember to use <code>MyAppText</code> instead of <code>Text</code>, but maybe that’ll be easier to remember than peppering <code>.kerning</code> everywhere :smile:</p>

You can use the <code>symbolSize(by:)</code> modifier (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/chartcontent/symbolsize(by:)">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/chartcontent/symbolsize(by:)</a>) to size the points by data.</p>
<p>To make the points look like bubbles, you can use <code>.symbol(Circle().strokeBorder(lineWidth: 1))</code> so the symbols are drawn as stroked circles.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>Chart(data) {
    PointMark(
        x: .value(&quot;Wing Length&quot;, $0.wingLength),
        y: .value(&quot;Wing Width&quot;, $0.wingWidth)
    )
    .symbolSize(by: .value(&quot;Weight&quot;, $0.weight))
    .symbol(Circle().strokeBorder(lineWidth: 1))
}

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7BPBLE4|:
You can use <code>View.focusSection()</code> for this, which is newly available on macOS 13.0. Marking a view as a focus section causes the Tab loop to cycle through all of the section's focusable content as a group before moving on to the next thing in layout order. So, something like this should get you the sort of column-wise navigation you're after:</p>
<pre><code>struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            VStack {
                FocusableView()
                FocusableView()
            }
            .focusSection()

            VStack {
                FocusableView()
                FocusableView()
            }
            .focusSection()

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
Hi - this is a great question. You can certainly use <code>MenuBarExtra</code> to create a standalone menu bar app, though you may want to look into the <code>Info.plist</code> changes noted in the documentation:
&gt; For apps that only show in the menu bar, a common behavior is for the app to not display its icon in either the Dock or the application switcher. To enable this behavior, set the <code>LSUIElement</code> flag in your app’s <code>Info.plist</code> file to <code>true</code>.
If the menu bar app is used in conjunction with a main app, then you'll need to package it together (ie, the "helper app" model). Adding a login item sounds like the way to go if you want it to show at login regardless of the user's preference for restoring state.</p>
<p>|U03HHJH9C66|:
We'd also certainly welcome any feedbacks for enhancement requests in this area as well.</p>
<p>|U03HMDFMVNK|:
Got it, that combined with the new login item APIs this year should make this sort of thing a lot easier. Thanks!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Interesting question!</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
Without knowing the details of your app, my inclination would be to try the RedactionReasons API.</p>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
You can use the <code>.redacted</code> modifier to set a redaction reason. SwiftUI controls will automatically react to that, hiding sensitive data. You can also read the reason from the environment to redact in custom controls.</p>
<p>|U03JZNY81L0|:
Not the most elegant, but I’ve done something like this</p>
<pre><code>if let _ = auth.sessionToken {
  ContentView()
} else {
  AuthView()
}
</code></pre>
<p>|U03HW7P0HQR|:
You could also use an overlay modifier at the root of your hierarchy to present a view over the whole app, then adjust that view’s opacity based on the log in state.</p>
<p>|U03J21ZK802|:
Yeah, it's not a cookie cutter kind of problem but curious about other ideas</p>
<p>|U03J1V9U7U3|:
Personally, I’d prefer swapping <code>rootViewController</code> of the app’s window in a UIKit environment. I think the closest approach in SwiftUI would be as Andrew shared above. Not sure if this would cover the need in question though.</p>
<p>|U03JHARHUTD|:
This is my approach currently, but it’s got some drawbacks...  I’m interested to know how others are doing.</p>
<pre><code>WindowGroup {
    switch userSessionManager.isLoggedIn {
    case true:
        TabViewScreen()
            // .viewModifiers
            //(environmentObjects, etc.)
    case false:
        LoginScreen()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>|U03J21ZK802|:
Yeah, the main drawback of conditionally showing different content is you kind of destroy the user's current context as you show the <code>LoginScreen()</code> which is why I like the window approach</p>
<p>|U03JHARHUTD|:
I tried using .fullScreenCover instead to fix that. But that does not guarantee that your sensitive data will always be covered up when the user is logged out mid-session.
e.g. when another sheet or fullScreenCover from a subview is already shown, and even when it is dismissed later.
.objectWillChange isn’t called again and the login screen does not pop back up.</p>
<p>|U03JHARHUTD|:
This is actually still a problem with the above approach. So sadly I tend to avoid using sheets and fullScreenCovers for that reason.</p>

When you use a <code>switch</code> within a <code>@ViewBuilder</code> closure, you are in fact using the power of generics :wink:, but in most common cases you hopefully don’t have to think about that overtly.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
Can you provide a little more detail here? How are you trying to interact with the data points in the <code>Chart</code>? And the scroll view scroll gesture is interfering maybe?</p>
<p>|U03JEJJ52V8|:
My app uses data visualization to allow the user to edit errors.  So I would like the user to tap on the portion of the chart they are interested in and link to a  List below where that data row is then selected for editing</p>
<p>|U03JEJJ52V8|:
There can be hundreds of data points in the list so finding the correct one to edit can be cumbersome without the touch feature</p>
<p>|U03JEJJ52V8|:
I currently don’t use a scroll view but would like to as this would allow more space for tapping on the data element.</p>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
This talk <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10137">https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10137</a> has some examples of adding interaction</p>
<p>|U03HL00QL68|:
I think that would be orthogonal to the question of embedding the chart in a scroll view, but it may complicate hit detection depending on how big the chart is</p>
<p>|U03JEJJ52V8|:
It is an iPhone app so I don’t have lots of space.</p>

<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
You can change the color of the axis labels with the <code>.chart{X/Y}Axis</code> modifier, where you can configure the <code>foregroundStyle</code> of <code>AxisValueLabel</code> . Here is an example changing the label color for the Y axis:</p>
<pre><code>.chartYAxis {
    AxisMarks { _ in 
        AxisGridLine()
        AxisTick()
        AxisValueLabel().foregroundStyle(Color.red)
    }
}

<p>You can change the color of the grid line and tick in a similar way too.</p>
<p>|U03HVE7BD1U|:
Could it be that this currently doesn't work in the developer beta?
Because I just tried the following code and it applied the colors on the grid line and tick, but not on the label next to the tick.</p>

                AxisMarks { _ in
                    AxisGridLine()

                    AxisTick()
                    .foregroundStyle(.blue)

                    AxisValueLabel()

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKVDCL7N|:
Delegates do a lot of different things in UIKit, and so the way that they should be translated into SwiftUI can vary heavily depending on what they’re being used for in UIKit. In some situations they’ll become closures that you pass around, in others, a <code>Binding</code> or <code>State</code>, sometimes a <code>onChange(of:)</code>, etc. UIKit and SwiftUI have two very different programming models, so often times, concepts don’t map over in a one-to-one way.</p>

We recommend simplifying the data before rendering it. For your example, you could simplify the line or summarize the data points in small intervals (let’s say you have data for a year, you summarize the data for a day). The added advantage is that you can summarize using mean, min and max and show the full range within the small interval.</p>

<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
You could try setting <code>yStart</code> and <code>yEnd</code> for the area, here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>Chart(data) {
    AreaMark(
        x: .value(&quot;Date&quot;, $0.date),
        yStart: .value(&quot;Start Price&quot;, 100),
        yEnd: .value(&quot;Price&quot;, $0.price)
    )
}
.chartYScale(domain: .automatic(includesZero: false))
</code></pre>
<p>The automatic option will use nicely rounded numbers. If that's not working for you, you can also set the domain directly like <code>domain: 100 ... 1000</code></p>
<p>|U03HMDT7AET|:
:thinking_face: the first suggestion doesn’t quit work because there is some padding added to the y range. I’ll give a specific range a try next.</p>
<p>|U03HMDT7AET|:
Just setting a range doesn’t quit work either… I guess I would need to do both?</p>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
Umm, could you try turning off <code>roundLowerBound</code> in axis marks? Full code would be like this:</p>
<pre><code>Chart(data) {
    AreaMark(
        x: .value(&quot;Date&quot;, $0.date),
        yStart: .value(&quot;Start Price&quot;, 100),
        yEnd: .value(&quot;Price&quot;, $0.price)
    )
}
.chartYScale(domain: .automatic(includesZero: false))
.chartXAxis {
    AxisMarks(values: .automatic(roundLowerBound: false))
}
</code></pre>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
<code>roundLowerBound</code> tries to add a round number below the data range, that might be why we are seeing a 40,000 value below the area like in your first screenshot.</p>
<p>|U03HMDT7AET|:
That works</p>

<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
Like this?</p>
<p>|U03J22AU6DQ|:
Yep</p>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
This screenshot is from the Hello Swift Charts talk. Let me find the code for it.</p>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
You can use a custom symbol (<code>Arrow</code> ).</p>
<pre><code>        Chart(data, id: \.x) {
            PointMark(x: .value(&quot;x&quot;, $0.x), y: .value(&quot;y&quot;, $0.y))
                .symbol(Arrow(angle: CGFloat(angle))
                .foregroundStyle(by: .value(&quot;angle&quot;, angle))
                .opacity(0.7)
        }

...

    struct Arrow: ChartSymbolShape {
        let angle: CGFloat
        let size: CGFloat

        func path(in rect: CGRect) -&amp;gt; Path {
            let w = rect.width * size * 0.05 + 0.6
            var path = Path()
            path.move(to: CGPoint(x: 0, y: 1))
            path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: -0.2, y: -0.5))
            path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 0.2, y: -0.5))
            path.closeSubpath()
            return path.applying(.init(rotationAngle: angle))
                .applying(.init(scaleX: w, y: w))
                .applying(.init(translationX: rect.midX, y: rect.midY))
        }

        var perceptualUnitRect: CGRect {
            return CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 1, height: 1)
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
This is not the complete code but should give you enough to make the example.</p>
<p>|U03J22AU6DQ|:
Nice! That’s the thing I was looking for, thank you!</p>
<p>|U03J22AU6DQ|:
Alright, I’m getting closer :smile: What’s left is to figure out what the format was used for <code>data</code> in the sample and where angle came from :thinking_face:</p>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
Very cool.</p>
<p>|U03J22AU6DQ|:
And here we go</p>
<p>|U03J22AU6DQ|:
It is quite delightful to use this framework and the performance is great. Many thanks to the team :pray:</p>
<p>Though, documentation seems to be out of sync with reality a bit. For example, this snippet from <code>PointMark</code> does not compile. I’m assuming that the functionality with KeyPaths is not in the first beta yet since I recall similar syntax from the sessions</p>

<h4 id="how-are-large-datasets-handled-is-there-automatic-sampling-or-some-kind-of-recommended-limit">How are large datasets handled, is there automatic sampling or some kind of recommended limit?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
There is no automatic sampling in Swift Charts. I would expect the "preferred" sampling method to vary on a case-by-case basis. I think the best approach is to see what works for you and then sample in a manner that is honest to your data as you run into performance issues. We're always looking to improve the performance of the framework! File feedback if you run into issues.</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
As a general design principle, I would recommend simplifying / aggregating data  as it becomes large. It's rarely useful to look at large amounts of raw data on the screen, as you run into the limits of 2d rendering wrt to occlusion, fidelity, and noise resolution.</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
Does that help &lt;@U03HZ4PT2ER&gt;?</p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
&lt;@U03H3193G3H&gt; A little, so are you recommending at most one mark per screen point?</p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
and would we use GeometryReader to get that info?</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
One point per screen point is probably excessive too (from a legibility perspective, if not a performance one)... it would help to get an idea of what you are trying to achieve &amp; what your data looks like</p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
We draw a lot of scientific data, some is discrete, other is calculated/continuous</p>
<p>|U03J5J0TUN9|:
Can you give a rough estimate to what number of marks the Charts will scale? Like a 1000? I’d also like to plot data that comes in every other second in a scroll view, and would probably have to cut off at some point?</p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
Our data is available at once, and can have 5000 points. It will be static with no points just the lines</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
cc &lt;@U03HHJH7RJN&gt;!</p>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
It depends on the machine performance and complexity of the chart. It's usually a good idea to test with your actual data and chart to figure out how many points can be drawn with acceptable user experience.</p>
<p>|U03J5J0TUN9|:
No rough scale? Like 100, 1000, 10k, 100k no problem? On say an iPhone 12 Mini?</p>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
Based on my experience it's about 1000 to 2000 for smooth animations.</p>
<p>|U03J5J0TUN9|:
Thanks!</p>

<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
&lt;@U03HW7NSMFT&gt; Interesting, we already have histograms, which we handle differently from this, but I will take a look</p>
<p>|U03JRNE4KJL|:
For large data sets scrolling is inevitable. I guess we have to embed some Chart views into something's like a lazyhgrid - assuming that we can get rid of any padding/scaling numbers to get a seamless/infinite chart. Is that doable?</p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
&lt;@U03JRNE4KJL&gt; you might be able to do that with the chartOverlay and manual drawing with the axis objects, then handle gestures for scrolling</p>

<h4 id="how-easy-is-it-to-support-interactions-like-pan-to-move-and-pinch-to-zoom">How easy is it to support interactions like pan-to-move and pinch-to-zoom?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
For pan-to-move, you can use a SwiftUI gesture in conjunction with <code>ChartProxy</code>. From the gesture, you get the the pan distance, and then you can use <code>ChartProxy</code> to figure out the pan distance in the data domain. Then, you can set the domain for the X scale with <code>.chartXScale(domain: start + offset...end + offset)</code> , where you can adjust the offset to pan the chart.</p>
<p>|U03HMD88UPR|:
Can a similar strategy be used for pinch-to-zoom?</p>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
Yes, you can use a pinch to zoom gesture (or any other gesture) and hook up the events in a similar way.</p>
<p>|U03J21ZK802|:
Without location information (like the new <code>SpatialTapGesture</code>) it would be a bit unnatural as we wouldn't know where to center the zoom, right? <code>MagnificationGesture</code> doesn't provide location information, unless I've missed something</p>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
Feel free to file a feedback to SwiftUI for providing location information to gestures.</p>
<p>For now I think you can try implement a <code>UIView</code> with <code>UIPinchGestureRecognizer</code> and then wrap the view with <code>UIViewRepresentable</code> so it can be used in SwiftUI.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
absolutely! An easy way to do this is to store the desired highlighted data's ids in a <code>@State</code> and check against that in your <code>ForEach</code> of <code>Marks</code>. Something along the lines of</p>
<pre><code>ForEach(data) { value in

    .foregroundStyle(value.id == state.highlighted ? Color.red : Color.gray)

<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
We generally recommend aggregating very large datasets since there are only so many marks that can be rendered and reasonably read by a user. Swift Charts can process and render a reasonable number of data points.</p>

Thank you!</p>

<h4 id="is-there-multiple-axis-support-logarithmic-axis-support">Is there multiple axis support? Logarithmic axis support?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
A Swift Charts chart can only have one axis per x and y. Swift Charts supports logarithmic scales.</p>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
For example, you can specify a log scale on x with</p>
<p><code>.chartXScale(type: .log)</code></p>
<p>|U03J21ZK802|:
Thanks</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
You can however, have multiple sets of labels / ticks / grid lines by adding multiple <code>AxisMarks</code></p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
they will share the same scale, but might be useful for things like displaying both <code>C</code> and <code>F</code> on the same chart</p>
<p>|U03J21ZK802|:
Yeah, we often have requirements to show multiple data sets with varying scales for comparisons</p>
<p>|U03J21ZK802|:
Can you put those different sets of marks on opposite sides of the chart?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
Love to hear it &lt;@U03J21TPWPM&gt;! I think I can guess what is going on here. If a label is placed beyond the edge of the axis, (as can be the case with the last value of a list of dates, as it would define the end of your date range) it won't be rendered, as it would run off the edge of the chart.</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
Off the top of my head, solutions may include: adding a bit of "padding" in your date range or switching the axis style.</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
does that help?</p>

Yes, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
An axis always has one scale. So x and y have one scale. You can have multiple axes to display e.g. temperature in C and F. If you want to show multiple measures, I would recommend multiple charts with aligned x-axes. You can even hide the axis of the upper chart to create a more compact view.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
The label key is used for generating a good default description for the chart for VoiceOver users and the audio graph. For example, if you have <code>x: .value("time", ...), y: .value("sales", ...)</code> , VoiceOver users will hear something like "x axis shows time, y axis shows sales".
The label key in <code>foregroundStyle</code> doesn't necessarily need to match <code>LineMark</code>, but it's a good practice to use the same label if the data is the same.</p>

<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
Thank you. Its’ great to hear that you enjoy the API.</p>
<p>Swift Charts is a grammar based visualization language, which means charts are composed of building blocks (marks and mark properties) instead of picked from a list of chart types (vertical bar chart, bubble chart, waterfall chart etc). The Grammar of Graphics was hugely influential for many visualization APIs like ggplot, D3, Vega and also Swift Charts.</p>

<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
this is a pixel boundary rendering artifact. One solution is to make the width just a tadddd over 1 so they overlap just a bit</p>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
It's a rendering artifact that happens when the bars doesn't align with pixel boundaries. There are a couple of ways to address it:
• As Halden mentioned, you can make the bars slightly wider (with something like <code>.inset(-1)</code> or <code>.ratio(1.01)</code>)
• You can also tweak the width of the plot area (with <code>.chartPlotStyle { $0.frame(width: plotAreaWidth) }</code>) based on the number of bars, so that the bars are aligned exactly with pixel boundaries. This is more complex to do, but will give the best result.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
You could make a chart with three bars one for each category. If you set the scale to have a domain from e.g. 0 to 100, then the length of a bar indicates the progress towards a goal. A horizontal bar chart could work well.</p>
<p>|U03HZ49EE1K|:
Thanks &lt;@U03HW7NSMFT&gt; that's exactly what I was thinking, too.  But unsure on upper bound of chart when goal is exceeded.  For rings, if my steps goal is 5000 and I actually take 12000, then it would show 240% for that bar.</p>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
That’s an interesting consideration. You could have a chart that extends beyond 5000 but adds a vertical <code>RuleMark</code>  to annotate the goal.</p>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
Since you may show different metrics (e.g. steps and distance), you may want to normalize them to % of goal so they have the same scale/axis.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
Humans have a hard time with anything more than 10Hz anyway...</p>
<p>|U03J7BR0RKJ|:
We recommend benchmarking your app to find the right balance between the update rate and the amount of data on your line chart.  We'd also appreciate feedback through Feedback Assistant for your use case!</p>
<p>|U03JKLW88TZ|:
If I may follow up: if we're to alter the drawing rate so it adds new data points in batches, does Charts have built-in functionality for that, or would we need to set up the Combine publishers manually? I didn't see anything in the documentation, but I understand the docs could also be in beta</p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
Honestly at 40Hz I think you're looking at game semantics, i.e. Metal or at least SceneKit</p>
<p>|U03JKLW88TZ|:
Yeah when I previously worked on the project that would use my own pre-"Swift Charts" charts. I experimented with rendering the charts using Metal, and that was not a very productive week :sweat_smile:</p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
You would need to write a small framework, but SceneKit (or even SpriteKit?) could do a lot of the work</p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
But I think you need to isolate your fast-updating surfaces and not drag all of UIKit/SwiftUI into it otherwise the performance will crash</p>

I’m not sure I fully got the question but you can either draw points as separate with <code>PointMark</code>  or linked with a <code>LineMark</code> . Adding linked points is well supported by Swift Charts.</p>

<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
You can create custom marks but they need to be cartesian. So you can make e.g. a candlestick or boxplot. Swift Charts does not support pie charts or 3D charts. See <a href="https://wwdc22.slack.com/archives/C03HX19UNCQ/p1654618060787259">https://wwdc22.slack.com/archives/C03HX19UNCQ/p1654618060787259</a> for a discussion of alternatives.</p>

Thank you. So I would assume a 2D bar graph with a fake 3D effect for the bar marks should be easily doable. But no circular graphs (for now).</p>

<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
&lt;@U03JF5S79RQ&gt; sorry for the late reply! Yes, there are a few options here. You can use <code>AxisMarks(format: FormatStyle)</code> or <code>AxisValueLabel(format: FormatStyle)</code> or <code>AxisValueLabel { Text(\(..., format: ...)) }</code></p>
<p>|U03JF5S79RQ|:
:heart: Perfect, thanks!</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
If your units are more verbose, a design alternative is to clarify them in the title or headline of your chart, to save horizontal space on the y axis.</p>
<p>|U03JF5S79RQ|:
At this time I'm tracking price averages per month over the last 12 months, the user will have the ability to toggle between the last 12 and 6 months. The X axis is the Month, the Y axis is the Average Price.</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:

<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
Can you clarify what you mean by the preview option? Charts can be in any SwiftUI View.</p>
<p>|U03JEDKRZJ6|:
contextMenu(menuItems:preview:)
Using the contextMenu in a touch and hold scenario for a button that would lead to the view with a graph - can the live graph be shown? or is it only for fixed assets like an image?</p>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
You can use Swift Charts to draw live data.</p>
<p>|U03JEDKRZJ6|:
But does it update for the preview, or when you've  loaded the view with the chart?</p>
<p>|U03HW7NSMFT|:
Swift Charts behaves like other Views and updates the same way.</p>
<p>|U03JEDKRZJ6|:
So is the contextMenu preview a View in its own right?</p>

I’m not familiar with the contextMenu preview but it looks like it might work. Give it a try and if it doesn’t work file a feedback.</p>

You can use the <code>annotation</code> modifier to add an annotation on top of the bar, where the content of the annotation is a SF Symbol image. Here's an example:</p>

.annotation(position: .top) {
    Image(systemName: &quot;sfsymbol_name&quot;)

Ok I understand now. I think you're approach is good! (turning it into a number and then applying a reverse and customizing the axis labels). This is a clever solution, I dig it.</p>

<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
cc: &lt;@U03J21TPWPM&gt; in case this is the same issue you're running in to and my response to you is incorrect</p>
<p>|U03JDV4PQR0|:
Is it possible to get a reference to the colors automatically assigned to the series by the foregroundStyle?  I may want to create my own legend in a vertical format. Unless legends can be formatted vertically?</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
You can try positioning the legend on the trailing edge of the chart using the <code>chartLegend</code> modifier</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
The default color scale is currently as follows: all <code>system</code> colors</p>
<p><code>.systemBlue</code>, <code>.green</code>, <code>.orange</code>, <code>.purple</code>, <code>.red</code>, <code>.teal</code>, <code>.yellow</code></p>
<p>|U03J21TPWPM|:
&lt;@U03H3193G3H&gt; Thanks for letting me know :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>This looks very similar, yes. In my use case, I could fix it by adding additional data points, since it was a very simple graph and I don't mind the extra points.</p>
<p>Just in case it is a bug, I'm gonna send a report with the project, maybe it helps :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
thanks &lt;@U03J21TPWPM&gt;!</p>
<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
(btw &lt;@U03J21TPWPM&gt; if you don't want to add extra points, you can adjust the <code>chartXScale(domain:)</code> or <code>range</code> manually and achieve the same result.)</p>
<p>|U03J21TPWPM|:
Ah, that sounds even better :smile:. Thanks!</p>

<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
Currently we don't have a <code>scaleEffect</code> modifier. You can use something like <code>width: .fixed(hovering ? 100 : 80)</code> in <code>BarMark</code> constructor. This will make the bar wider when <code>hovering</code> is true.</p>

<p>|U03H3193G3H|:
Hi &lt;@U03HMESB695&gt;! Charts handles <code>Date</code> as a continuous variable, so this should be fine. If you <em>do</em> want to treat the data as spaced out evenly (e.g., exactly one measurement per day) you can tell the framework to do so by using the <code>unit</code> parameter in a <code>value</code></p>
<p>|U03HMESB695|:
Thanks! I definitely don’t want it spaced evenly. Great to hear it just handles it approriately.</p>

<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
&lt;@U03HHJH7RJN&gt; Basically we'd like to replicate our current draw-to-PDF behaviors which favor line art, simple coloring, and optional line dashes for monochrome</p>

&lt;@U03HHJH7RJN&gt; So does that mean we can't pass in a ChartView and apply styles just for the rendering?</p>
<p>|U03HHJH7RJN|:
No, currently there isn't a way to configure styling of the renderer itself. You could try an approach like exporting the rendered content as PDF or SVG and apply the styling by transforming the resulting vector graphics.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H32HJQEB|:
If you're experiencing long times to render there might be something specific about your setup. Filing a feedback with a sysdiagnose taken while the preview is taking the long time to render would be very helpful for us to diagnose this.</p>
<p>As far as general tips to keep things fast, it helps to break up you views into smaller components where possible. And if your app project itself takes a long time to build, then it could be very helpful to split your Swift UI views out into a separate framework target so they could be built without the burden of the rest of the project.</p>
<p>|U03JEMNCV18|:
&lt;@U03H32HJQEB&gt; Could you elaborate on separating out the SwiftUI views? I am currently working on an objc app and adding new SwiftUI screens, but the builds can sometimes take a while because the rest of the app is somewhat large. Anything I can do to speed that up without having to copy paste the SwiftUI code to a blank SwiftUI project would be awesome</p>
<p>|U03J4D7EZNY|:
&lt;@U03H32HJQEB&gt;  Yes I was just thinking about this last advice — although perhaps with a Package rather than a framework.</p>
<p>|U03JEMNCV18|:
(I don't even know objc really so I try to stay out of it)</p>
<p>|U03HHK591AP|:
&lt;@U03JEMNCV18&gt; I think the general theme is trying to focus on building as little as possible. If you can build out those new SwiftUI views in a framework / package, you can opt to build just that package rather than all of the app.</p>
<p>|U03JEMNCV18|:
I've considered doing that, but have never dove into creating a framework or package. But i'm tempted now..</p>
<p>|U03H32HJQEB|:
Yup, packages would be fine, too. It's even easier to use them in Xcode now. The larger point is to break out the parts that need Swift UI into their own targets that can be built independently. It might even help to have a separate "previewing" app target that you link your Swift UI views into instead of your main app. It all depends on your setup, of course. The tl;dr is that Previews needs to build <em>some</em> target to get its work done. If your whole app target is large and slow to build then it will be the bottleneck for previews that you can investigate.</p>
<p>Of course you might find other bugs on our end that slow things down. Please file feedback reports with sysdiagnosen! :)</p>

Do you know if this is resolved in Xcode 14?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW8Y0RFB|:
Thanks for the feedback! Right now the recommendation is to limit the Preview Content folder (which is really just a convenience for the <code>DEVELOPMENT_ASSET_PATHS</code> build setting) to assets like asset catalogs, preview data, etc.</p>
<p>For code, we recommend you continue to keep it in your normal source paths, but to wrap with <code>#if</code> . Note: the compiler will normally remove any preview providers from the final binary without needing the <code>#if</code>, but the <code>#if</code> is a guarantee it won’t be included.</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
It’s specifically preview data that we are using in the previews. The problem is our Staging target, and the mismatch between what is being compiled out for Previews vs Preview Content.</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
It seems like those two should agree on what is being compiled out.</p>
<p>|U03HMELQWLX|:
I’ve also had this problem, I made this SO post for it. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63078880/why-does-archive-fail-if-there-is-code-for-swiftui-previews-in-the-preview-conte">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63078880/why-does-archive-fail-if-there-is-code-for-swiftui-previews-in-the-preview-conte</a></p>
<p>|U03HMELQWLX|:
I filed FB8969539 for this issue.</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
Yep, that’s exactly it Jeremy.</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
So annoying because we sometime forget to wrap our new views in the DEBUG check. I need to invest in some script / linter to check this, but I was hoping this problem would go away in Xcode 14.</p>
<p>|U03HW8Y0RFB|:
If you don’t put any <em>code</em> in Preview Content, then the compiler will usually be able to correctly remove any branches of code used only for previews.</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
But it is code, and that seems very useful. Do you have other recommendations?</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
I think you’re recommending to move that code out of Preview Content and :crossed_fingers: that it is removed from release builds?</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
I’ll give that a shot. Thanks!</p>
<p>|U03HMELQWLX|:
How would it get removed from the release builds? I don’t know of any other mechanism other than #if DEBUG</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
I think that’s what is being recommended – move the code out of Preview Content and manually wrap the entire code in an if DEBUG check.</p>
<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
But it seems less than ideal since Preview Content is built for <em>exactly</em> this use case. What is compiled out should match between PreviewProvider and Preview Content.</p>
<p>|U03HMELQWLX|:
Fully agreed.</p>
<p>|U03HW8Y0RFB|:
The compiler optimizes by removing non-public symbols that aren’t referenced from any top level code. This will remove most preview code that is not referenced by other public or used types.</p>
<p>|U03HMELQWLX|:
Just to clarify my understanding, you are saying that it’s not supported use case to have code inside the Preview Contents folder that will be stripped out in Release builds?</p>
<p>|U03HMELQWLX|:
Note that this contradicts what was implied in WWDC 2020's session “Structure your app for SwiftUI previews”.</p>
<p>&gt; “What’s great about Development Assets is they apply not only to files like Asset catalogs, but also to code. Let’s look at what’s inside that preview content folder that we just added.”
&gt; 
&gt; By using the navigator, we can look inside and see two Swift files. These Swift files contain code that I only need for development and debugging and testing my app, and I don’t want to include these when my app is actually deployed.

<p>|U03J3BK549Y|:
• SwiftUI previews - compiled out of exactly “Release”
• Preview Content – NOT compiled out of “Debug”
Ultimately it seems odd to me that these two things have different strategies. Everything discussed in this thread is <em>fine</em> but we have to acknowledge that everything we’re currently doing (#if DEBUG) or recommended in this thread is a <em>workaround</em> for the disconnect between the above bullet points.</p>
<p>|U03HW8Y0RFB|:
Great thoughts and responses everyone!</p>
<p>&gt; Just to clarify my understanding, you are saying that it’s not supported use case to have code inside the Preview Contents folder that will be stripped out in Release builds?
It’s not <em><em>unsupported</em></em> ( :slightly_smiling_face: ) to put code in Preview Content, but we’ve found it to work <em>best</em> when Preview Content is limited to assets.</p>
<p>&gt; Note that this contradicts what was implied in WWDC 2020's session “Structure your app for SwiftUI previews”

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HW8Y0RFB|:
Thanks for the question! There’s not currently a variant mode in the canvas for different iOS versions. However, there is a neat solution! If you have a physical iPhone that is running iOS 15, you can use on-device previews to see your simulator preview in the canvas (running iOS 16) and the preview running on device (running iOS 15). And any changes you make will automatically be updated in both places at the same time!</p>
<p>If you have other use cases for seeing multiple OS versions, please file a Feedback Request so we can take a look, thanks!</p>

Core Data supports pointing to in-memory storage which won't need the file system and would work great in any situation where you don't want to persist the changes permanently, even in Previews.</p>

Thanks for the question. We know there are cases where previews don’t work and we’re actively working on addressing them. The best way to help us is to file a Feedback Request and attach the previews diagnostics. Look for an upcoming message about great tips for filing previews bugs to make it easy for us to investigate! Thanks!</p>
<p>|U03JSSE35GQ|:
&lt;@U03HW8Y0RFB&gt; One unrelated issue I encountered today was that the compiler took too much time to compile the code because it was trying to guess the type of a rather simple expression for an human but not for a computer. Perhaps you could handle this specific case by displaying a dedicated message so that the developer precisely knows what the preview is waiting for.</p>
<p>|U03HW8Y0RFB|:
Thanks for the feedback &lt;@U03JSSE35GQ&gt;, that’s a great idea. We’ve been tracking a number of issues related to type checking, so we’re on it! :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

<p>|U03HW8Y0RFB|:
Thanks for the question! Ha, yes, definitely not expected :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>This is a known issue that we are actively looking at. In the meantime, a workaround is to add a <code>typealias</code> inside of the <code>struct</code> that references the other view. For example in your example I added <code>typealias MyChildView = MyNameSpace.MyChildView</code> inside of <code>MyContainerView</code> and the preview renders.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHK591AP|:
Hey Tyler, great question! The current recommendation is to attach to the process and use the view debugger.</p>
<p>The runtime view debugger does not provide the same level of detail that you get when using the inspector in Previews – are there specific details that you are looking for in the view debugger?</p>
<p>|U03KJNRADEC|:
&lt;@U03HHK591AP&gt; Can you suggest how to use background(color.red.ignoreSafeArea()) together with .cornerRadius? It just dont work :(</p>
<p>|U03J1UU7HS7|:
Sorry, I realized that this question wasn’t actually preview-specific until after I posted.  Previews are great for eyeballing layout and validating behavior, but I use the inspector to validate specific fonts, frames, etc.  Historically we’ve used internal tooling for inspection against UIViews, etc. from tests and interactive inspectors.  We’re rethinking this approach as we migrate to SwiftUI, but still curious if there’s a public way to ask an arbitrary view for this info.  The Xcode inspector seems to be able to focus on an arbitrary view and dump useful info.</p>
<p>|U03J1UU7HS7|:
Re previews and eyeballing - I take this back.  There’s a lot I can check in non-interactive mode.</p>
<p>|U03J1UU7HS7|:
However, there are still other cases in which I’d like to have access to this type of general info outside of the context of previews.</p>
<p>|U03HHK591AP|:
In particular, what level of detail are you looking for with the font? i.e. Is it a custom font that you’re trying to validate or are you trying to make sure something is actually using a system font like <code>.heading</code></p>
<p>|U03J1UU7HS7|:
We use custom fonts, yes.  Consider the scenario - we have a large app; currently, I (or say, a designer) can nav to an arbitrary screen, open up our in-process inspector; focus on a view and inspect its attributes.  All without connecting via Xcode and attaching.</p>
<p>|U03J1UU7HS7|:
My assumption here is that we’re entering a new world with new tools and introspection like this isn’t straight forward.  But was still curious if there was something I’m missing.</p>
<p>|U03HHK591AP|:
Gotcha. To answer your question, I don’t believe that level of introspection is available but we’re interested in hearing more about what you’re looking for. Could you please open a feedback request to help us track interest in a feature like that?</p>
<p>|U03J1UU7HS7|:
Absolutely!  Thanks.</p>

If you'd like to see the borders of each view in the preview you can use the non-interactive mode then in the menu bar go to Editor &gt; Canvas &gt; Show View Bounds. Additionally, you can toggle "Show Clipped Views" in the same menu to show or hide views that extend beyond the edges of the preview.</p>

<p>|U03HMELQWLX|:
Just in general, I wanted to say that Xcode Previews are life-changing. I honestly feel that I’m about 10x more productive with the combination of SwiftUI + Xcode Previews. Being able to rapidly iterate on a view to get it just how I want completely changes my approach to things. Now I just dive in, and start coding, and continually refine until it’s perfect. With .xibs, I would give up far before the point of perfection.</p>
