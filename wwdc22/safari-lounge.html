    We believe there's an issue with recent versions of Safari where Safari will not obey a 'Set-Cookie' directive if it's issued as part of a '401 Unauthorized' response from the server. (This runs counter to  RFC6265 which states that user agents MUST process Set-Cookie headers in 400-level responses.)  The problem for us is that this breaks our Single Sign-On with our identity provider. For basic web browsing we just tell our users to use "any browser other than Safari", but the problem is unavoidable when it comes to authentication requests from Microsoft Office 365, which uses an embedded instance of Safari. So our Mac users lose out on the smooth sign-in experience that our Windows users enjoy.  We've had an Enterprise AppleCare case open for a year for this, but it has gotten no traction.  I would love any advice or information I could add to our ticket that might help get it closer to resolution. In particular, would this fall under Safari, or WebKit, or maybe even somewhere else in macOS? Thanks so much!

    Apologies for this question without too much research ahead of time, but while I've got your ears: can the drop event handler in a WKWebView page convey, for example, information about a dropped image file to the host app, and can the host app inherit implied sandbox entitlement to read from the URL? Likewise for file promises (e.g. from the screenshot proxy on macOS). I haven't dug into this yet but basically I wonder what I'm up against migrating from WebView based in-process drag/copy/paste handling. Any tips or warnings about what I can or can't do? I imagine in the worst case scenario I can pipe the bytes of the dragged file over to the host app.

    Hi, Are we expected to actively migrate existing APNs safari web push users to the standard?   If so, in that migration scenario, are users required to perform a user gesture and accept notifications again, or can we detect that on page load (using something like Notification.permission === granted after feature detection) and silently move them from APNs to the w3c push?

    We believe there's an issue with recent versions of Safari where Safari will not obey a 'Set-Cookie' directive if it's issued as part of a '401 Unauthorized' response from the server. (This runs counter to  RFC6265 which states that user agents MUST process Set-Cookie headers in 400-level responses.)  The problem for us is that this breaks our Single Sign-On with our identity provider. For basic web browsing we just tell our users to use "any browser other than Safari", but the problem is unavoidable when it comes to authentication requests from Microsoft Office 365, which uses an embedded instance of Safari. So our Mac users lose out on the smooth sign-in experience that our Windows users enjoy.  We've had an Enterprise AppleCare case open for a year for this, but it has gotten no traction.  I would love any advice or information I could add to our ticket that might help get it closer to resolution. In particular, would this fall under Safari, or WebKit, or maybe even somewhere else in macOS? Thanks so much!

    Apologies for this question without too much research ahead of time, but while I've got your ears: can the drop event handler in a WKWebView page convey, for example, information about a dropped image file to the host app, and can the host app inherit implied sandbox entitlement to read from the URL? Likewise for file promises (e.g. from the screenshot proxy on macOS). I haven't dug into this yet but basically I wonder what I'm up against migrating from WebView based in-process drag/copy/paste handling. Any tips or warnings about what I can or can't do? I imagine in the worst case scenario I can pipe the bytes of the dragged file over to the host app.

</blockquote>
<p>Web Push in Safari works... just like Web Push in any browser!</p>
<p>We've implemented all the cross-browser web standards needed to support Web Push. If your site already supports Web Push in other browsers and you don't exclude Safari through browser detection, Safari 16 on macOS Ventura will work with your site.</p>
<p>No Apple Developer Program membership is required. We use standard VAPID to manage push subscriptions.</p>
<p>In addition to excluding Safari through browser detection, some websites tightly manage push endpoint URLs server side. If you do that, allow all subdomains of <a href="http://push.apple.com|push.apple.com">http://push.apple.com|push.apple.com</a></p>

<p>Look for iOS/iPadOS support in 2023</p>
<p>&lt;@U03JMRY8ERZ&gt; We'd love your uses cases wrapped up in a Feedback Assistant report!</p>
<p>Can you clarify whether Web Push will work in an SFSafariViewController on macOS Ventura? Or does it <em>only</em> work in Safari 16?</p>
<p>Only in Safari 16 :+1:</p>
<p>I'd also be curious to understand what the use case for web push would be in WKWebView or SFSafariViewController. If you use that you have an app that supports native push?</p>
<p>My web app receives a lot of traffic from Facebook's in-app browser, which is a WKWebView. When users navigate to my site from a Facebook link, they won't be able to sign up for push notifications.</p>
<p>For some sites, a very high percentage of their traffic comes from in-app browsers, some of which are WKWebViews, and some of which are SFSafariViewControllers. (I think it's fair to argue that Facebook ought to use SFSVC instead of WKWebView, but that's neither here nor there.) It especially seems like an oversight not to allow web push in an SFSafariViewController.</p>
<p>Does Facebook have a native app on macOS with an in-app browser? I don't see one on the Mac App Store, but maybe they provide it as a direct download?</p>
<p>Perhaps their iPad app runs on an Apple Silicon Mac? I might find time to look into that more later. :crossed_fingers:</p>

<h4 id="hey-two-questions-about-web-push-is-the-uservisibleonly-flag-supported-and-is-the-api-available-in-webextensions">Hey! Two questions about Web Push: is the <code>userVisibleOnly</code> flag supported, and is the API available in WebExtensions?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>userVisibleOnly</code> flag is in fact required; You are not allowed to subscribe for push if you set the flag to <code>false</code></p>
<p>This is covered in the session here - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10098/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10098/</a></p>
<p>On macOS Ventura, the API is only available to websites visited in a browser tab in Safari 16.
We'd love to read use cases for support in extensions - Please file a Feedback Assistant issue!</p>
<p>Thanks! I'll definitely open a feedback but to share some more context in the meantime, we've been discussing this at the Web Extensions Community Group as an alternative to the (no longer reliable) WebSockets in MV3: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/issues/208">https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/issues/208</a>. Being able to set <code>userVisibleOnly</code> to <code>false</code> in extensions specifically would allow us to use it as a background notification mechanism and feels like less of a risk given that extensions are already running in the background.</p>
<p>Apple makes a comment around around this in the "Meet Web Push" video available today, at 13:38.
&gt; You must promise that pushes will be user visible. Handling a push event is not an invitation for your JavaScript to get silent background run time. Doing so would violate both the user's trust, and the user's battery life.
&gt;
&gt; When handling a push a event, you are in fact required to post a notification to notification center. Other browsers all have counter measures against violating the promise to make notifications user visible, and so does Safari.
&gt;
&gt; In the beta build of macOS Ventura, after three push events where you fail to push a notification in a timely manner, your site's push subscription will be revoked. You will need to go through the permission workflow again.</p>
<p>Thanks &lt;@U03JMRY8ERZ&gt;! That matches up with the other browsers, so no surprises there. If notifications do ever come to extensions, though, I'd still love to see a relaxing of this requirement. It feels like a slightly different threat model and one where background run time may be appropriate.</p>
<p>(I know you're not from Apple, but just sharing what my response would be)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for trying it out with your site! We need a little more info to better understand your question.
Do you mean your website didn't show the button to subscribe, like it does in other browsers?
Or do you mean that the button appears, but clicking it does nothing?</p>
<p>Hi Brady,</p>
<p>I cannot see this alert pop-up</p>
<p>Is there any demo website I can test with this push API? Not sure why… I upgraded to the macOS 13.0, and all the web notifications that worked before disappeared too:smiling_face_with_tear:.</p>
<p>Okay!</p>
<p>When we were developing the feature, many sites "just worked," but others unwittingly excluded Safari. There was a few common reasons for this.</p>
<p>One common one was a site not setting the <code>userVisibleOnly</code> flag in subscription requests, or setting it to false. WebKit requires pushes to be user visible, so that flag must be set to true.</p>
<p>If that were the case, you would see an error in Web Inspector. There's a few other less common errors that might show up in Web Inspector, so please check it out.</p>
<p>If nothing shows up there, it's also possible that even though your website's "subscribe" button shows up, it's not fully functional in Safari because some part of your stack is doing browser detection instead of feature detection.</p>
<p>Check to make sure your site to see if anything is doing a User Agent check or some other type of isSafari check, causing the button to not be fully functional.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that previously working Safari Push Notification subscriptions stopped working when you upgraded to Ventura. <em>Ugh</em></p>
<p>As far as I know we haven't seen that happen. Could you file a feedback assistant on that, with a full sysdiagnose, etc?</p>
<p>No problem. Let me pass your words to my team. Thank you, &lt;@U03J8RWC3A5&gt;</p>
<p>You're very welcome!</p>

<p>You should prefer CSS animations wherever you can, especially for things like transforms and opacity; if you need to implement animations yourself, using requestAnimationFrame and letting WebKit deal with the frame rate is the way to go.</p>

<p>Hi Cristina, Safari doesn’t block Google Analytics.

<p>Hi Wenson!  Thanks, I was not expecting to see a PR so fast.
While I’m here, any tips on getting our site out of the quirks mode list? We got added a couple years ago, it’s been causing a lot of trouble, and we believe we’ve mitigated the need for it by now.  Somebody pinged our Apple dev evangelist about it a while back, but nothing’s happened.  Should I just become a contributor on <a href="http://webkit.org|webkit.org">http://webkit.org|webkit.org</a> and submit a patch?</p>
<p>(Unfortunately I don’t have a FB or WebKit bug ID for that. I can certainly file one though.)</p>
<p>That’s a good question! It looks like <a href="http://figma.com|figma.com">http://figma.com|figma.com</a> was added to the quirks list to opt into “dispatch simulated mouse events” behaviors — I’ll see if I can figure out which bug that was intended to fix (if I recall correctly, that change was made during the push for desktop-class browsing on iPad)</p>
<p>Oh! I see, it’s related to <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196830">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196830</a> …perhaps we can follow up in that bug?</p>
<p>Right, it was around that time. In the meantime the site has adopted newer web pointer event APIs, so we shouldn’t need the simulated mouse events anymore.  (In fact they cause a lot of problems that are difficult to work around.)</p>
<p>Works for me, thanks for the attention!</p>
<p>That’s great to hear! Yes, in that case, it sounds like we can probably remove figma from the quirks list, then — <em>especially</em> if the quirked behavior is causing other issues, as well.
For what it’s worth, it’s also possible (as third party developers) to disable quirks in WebKit using Web Inspector, and test behaviors on websites without quirks. Let’s definitely follow up in the Bugzilla bug!</p>

<p>No new applications will be accepted that allow UIWebView, but existing UIWebView apps can continue to receive updates for now.</p>

<p>Let me ask this followup: Since you have a <em>rather unique</em> requirement of web content requiring the request to come from only 1 specific IP address... Is this web content entirely under your control?
If so, could you change it to use a custom URL scheme?</p>

<p>Thanks for your question and letting us know this is important to you. If you can provide details about how you plan to use this feature it can help our team prioritize this work. There is an existing <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174931|bug report">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174931|bug report</a> where you can share your use-case, or if you prefer, you can file feedback with <a href="http://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant">http://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant</a> and share details on your use-case confidentially.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the rapid iteration of ECMAScript that's making it seem like it's lagging but back in July of 2016 it was announced that <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/6756/es6-feature-complete/|Webkit was ES6 feature complete">https://webkit.org/blog/6756/es6-feature-complete/|Webkit was ES6 feature complete</a> only a year after it was ratified and then a year later in 2017 <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7536/jsc-loves-es6/|JSC :two_hearts: ES6">https://webkit.org/blog/7536/jsc-loves-es6/|JSC :two_hearts: ES6</a> showed great gains in optimization. But in all the years since there hasn't been a "Feature Complete" post... so just wondering what is Webkit's commitment to trying to maintain some parity with current ECMASCript specs?</p>

(This runs counter to  RFC6265 which states that user agents <em>MUST</em> process Set-Cookie headers in 400-level responses.)  The problem for us is that this breaks our Single Sign-On with our identity provider. For basic web browsing we just tell our users to use "any browser other than Safari", but the problem is unavoidable when it comes to authentication requests from Microsoft Office 365, which uses an embedded instance of Safari. So our Mac users lose out on the smooth sign-in experience that our Windows users enjoy.  We've had an Enterprise AppleCare case open for a year for this, but it has gotten no traction.  I would love any advice or information I could add to our ticket that might help get it closer to resolution. In particular, would this fall under Safari, or WebKit, or maybe even somewhere else in macOS? Thanks so much!</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Cookies are handled by <code>CFNetwork.framework</code>, so the issue exists at a different layer.</p>
<p>In addition to the Enterprise AppleCare case, it would be useful for software engineering to have a Feedback Assistant report open for the same issue, which includes the Enterprise AppleCare case ID, and (if possible) detailed steps to reproduce, or (even better) a stand-alone test case.  Please include an explanation of why this is needed (as you noted above) in the bug report.</p>
<p>You can create a Feedback ID now, then add details later if they aren’t handy to copy/paste at this time.  Post the Feedback ID here if possible.  If you don’t get the Feedback ID posted here in time, ask AppleCare to pass it along to CFNetwork.</p>
<p>Potentially related: Microsoft SSO requires 3P cookies which Safari blocks. There is a proposed FedCM standard for a browser API to address federation when 3P cookies are deprecated by all browsers.</p>
<p>Thanks, I’m working on the feedback now. The IdP is F5 BIG-IP. They document the problem in their knowledge base here:

<p>Thanks!  I’ll get the radar created for that over to the CFNetwork team now.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if the Feedback ID comes back in duped status—that just means the CFNetwork team found another radar tracking the issue.</p>

Do you have any tips for troubleshooting why the banner does not appear?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a number of possible reasons for the Smart App Banner not appearing; I don't know if any of these apply to you, but it's worth checking:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the user ever pressed the (X) on the banner for your app, Safari won't show it again.</li>
<li>If the user is in private browsing, Safari won't show the banner.</li>
<li>If the &lt;meta&gt; tag with the Smart App info is inserted programmatically, Safari won't show the banner.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a specific site where you're having trouble, and can reproduce it (even only sometimes), and it's not any of the cases above, I would definitely recommend filing feedback with the URL.</p>
<p>If you did press (X) is there a way to reset that? I read somewhere the device would need reset to factory settings to get it to work again.</p>
<p>For #3, our web team built the site in React. Can you clarify what you mean by programmatically?</p>
<p>(I'm checking on your first follow-up, but in the meantime:) Is the &lt;meta&gt; tag that contains the <code>apple-itunes-app</code> information inserted after the page is loaded, with JavaScript? Or is it in the main resource as served by the server? I'm not sure of the <em>precise</em> timing requirements, but that's definitely something to look into, if it is inserted after the fact.</p>
<p>As for your first question, it sounds like Clear Website Data (in Safari preferences) should reset the banner</p>
<p>Thank you! I will check with our web team, that might be the cause.</p>

Similar to how if a web view opens another, then its Window object is available in the child through <code>window.opener</code>. Would be great for complex interactions between two pages!</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The JavaScript window.opener relationship has semantics specific to tying a popup window to the window that opened it.</p>
<p>It is a web technology concept.</p>
<p>WKWebViews are an app developer technology. The concerns are not the same.</p>
<p>To better understand the question, can you tell me more about the complex interactions you think this would enable?</p>
<p>Let's say I have two WKWebViews with two different pages loaded in the same domain. Page A has a script loaded with access to a myriad of API functions. Page B does not. I'd like (in Javascript) to be able to access Page A's window object (and hence the API functions available in <code>window.api</code>) in Page B.</p>
<p>The way this is possible at the moment is if Page A calls <code>window.open</code> to create Page B, and then Page B can access the API through <code>window.opener.api</code>.</p>
<p>I was asking about the WKWebView level to see if I could "inject" the references at that point!</p>
<p>Hope that's clear!</p>
<p>I see. So you want to explicitly and manually <em>create</em> an opener-like relationship in native code, for hosted JavaScript to take advantage of.</p>
<p>I can see why that sounds appealing, but unfortunately it runs counter to the direction the web security model and web browser engines are headed.</p>
<p>E.g. there's a concerted effort by engine authors and also standards bodies to further limit what can be done with the window.opener relationship, and to make sure that whatever remains can be implemented with process isolation.</p>
<p>Now, the good news is that WKWebView <em>does</em> provide the tools you need to have JavaScript in one window object in one WKWebView talk to JavaScript in another window object in another WKWebView.</p>
<p>But your application process has to be a mediator through native code.</p>
<p>A combination of WKScriptMessageHandlers and/or WKUserScripts along with [WKWebView callAsyncJavaScript:] will let you set up a messaging path between two different WKWebViews.</p>
<p>The messaging will necessarily be asynchronous - no synchronous property access/function calls/etc.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the web content (e.g. whether you control it, or whether you trust it) you can also isolate your application's javascript from the web content via javascript worlds.</p>
<p>If you would like to pursue this further, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10188/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10188/</a> would be a great place to start.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info and the resource. Have got UserScripts and ScriptMessageHandlers working, but was really looking for a synchronous solution! (especially to iterate through the API object)</p>
<p>The answer to "Can I do this complicated thing between WKWebViews synchronously?" will always be no. :+1:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Both the &lt;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api
|Apple Pay JS&gt; and &lt;https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/
|W3C Payment Request&gt; APIs are supported in <code>WKWebView</code>.</p>
<p>In prior releases, it was the case that the &lt;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/518/
|Apple Pay could not be used at the same time as JavaScript injection&gt; (specifically at 9:34), but this restriction has been removed in iOS 16 and macOS 13.</p>
<p>Can you expand on your Picture-in-Picture question, what are you hoping to do?</p>
<p><em>Apple Pay</em>
Hmm I might be doing something wrong here, but couldn't get Apple Pay to work in WKWebView on macOS 11/12, even with zero JS injections. Great to read that the JS injections requirement has now been lifted on macOS 13! I use this link for testing: <a href="https://applepaydemo.apple.com/|https://applepaydemo.apple.com/">https://applepaydemo.apple.com/|https://applepaydemo.apple.com/</a></p>
<p><em>Picture-in-Picture</em>
Would just love to be able to start Picture in Picture mode when watching a video in WKWebView. This link is a good test case: <a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/picture-in-picture/|https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/picture-in-picture/">https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/picture-in-picture/|https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/picture-in-picture/</a></p>
<p><em>Extra information on Picture in Picture</em></p>
<p>When I enable it at the moment via <code>preferences._allowsPictureInPictureMediaPlayback = true</code>, although it works when running the app through Xcode, it fails when reopening the same app outside of Xcode (maybe something to do with having a debugger attached? but not sure why that would/could matter)</p>
<p>Are there any errors or anything like that in Web Inspector when you try to use Apple Pay?</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HFKHPLUX&gt; - yes, there is an error. I can check (don’t remember the exact error) but it had something to do with the app being sandboxed</p>
<p>The default value for <code>_allowsPictureInPictureMediaPlayback</code> is true in WKWebView, so you should not need to change it</p>
<p>And the leading underscore lets you know it is a private preference, which you shouldn't use if only because it could be removed or changed in the future without warning</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HFKHPLUX&gt;
<code>session.onCancel</code> is the error.</p>
<p>I followed the code in the WebKit codebase to deduce it might be related to sandboxing</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HFKHPLUX&gt; this is the error within WebKit (found by adding logs to my local copy and running the app with that build): <code>Error Domain=PKPassKitErrorDomain Code=4 "(null)"</code></p>
<p>Hmmm very odd.  Can you please file a bug via <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant">https://feedbackassistant.apple.com|Feedback Assistant</a> including steps to reproduce and system diagnostics?</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HW6FMWHH&gt; the value seems to be false by default on macOS, from what I can tell.
I was testing the private preference while looking for an official solution to see if it worked at all!  </p>
<p>Just to double check, is your device able to use Apple Pay?  If so, are you able to make purchases on other websites (i.e. have you added a credit/debit card to Wallet and configured all the other relevant info)?</p>
<p>Will do &lt;@U03HFKHPLUX&gt; - thank you for looking into this!</p>
<p>Yes you are correct, it is <code>false</code> by default on macOS</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HFKHPLUX&gt; - yes, Apple Pay works fine on Safari. Console logs also show the device is authorised for Apple Pay.
<code>Startup check: device is capable of making payments with Apple</code> <code>Pay</code></p>
<p>Ah ok then yes please file a bug and we'll take a look at it :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

Likewise for file promises (e.g. from the screenshot proxy on macOS). I haven't dug into this yet but basically I wonder what I'm up against migrating from <code>WebView</code> based in-process drag/copy/paste handling. Any tips or warnings about what I can or can't do? I imagine in the worst case scenario I can pipe the bytes of the dragged file over to the host app.</h4>

<p>While the <code>drop</code> JavaScript event handler in the page doesn’t have direct access to the dropped file URLs, it is possible to intercept the drop by subclassing <code>WKWebView</code> and overriding <code>-performDragOperation:</code>. You can then inspect the given <code>id &amp;lt;NSDraggingInfo&amp;gt;</code>‘s pasteboard, which should contain the file paths.
Ultimately, the web process’ capability to read dropped files comes from a sandbox extension from the host app, so the host app already has access to these dropped files.</p>
<p>Alternately, if changing native code is not a viable option, consuming the data in the webpage and propagating it to the host app is also possible — you can listen for the drop event, inspect the event’s <code>DataTransfer</code> for files via <code>DataTransfer.files</code>, and finally use <code>postMessage</code> to send the dropped data over to your app.</p>
