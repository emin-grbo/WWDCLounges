    Hi, Maps team! :wave: Do you plan any sort of Offline functionality for use with MapKit? There are plenty of Map frameworks available on Apple platforms, most notably the multiplatform Mapbox, also allowing things like tiles caching, prebundling with mbtiles files, etc. that empowers a huge set of mapping apps like trip planners, destination guides, and others. At this moment, the only possibility is drawing an externally sourced raster layer over the MapKit content, which is honestly so 2000s today – vectors are definitely the future. :rocket: Thank you!

    Hello! Wayfinding is a critical use case in our app, and we make extensive use of satellite view in both 2D and 3D.  Unfortunately the tiles used in MapKit are woefully out of date (several years old now) and many existing buildings look like construction sites or fields. Is there any way developers can flag regions as needing a new data load? We've tried using the built in location feedback in Maps but that doesn't seem to result in any improvement. The non-satellite maptypes have the new buildings with proper dimensions and we're happy about that, but we really would like for all types to be accurate.

Would you recommend a different approach, or is this likely the only way to do this? (MKMapView annotation from a -static- SwiftUI View)

    I've got a question about MKMapView when using MKMapType.satelliteFlyover with annotations. The annotations are positioned above (an inaccessible) minimal elevation. I assume this data comes from a database and is not exposed via an API.  When animating the annotation this sometimes looks strange because it jumps up and down (over trees for example).  Is there any way around this?  I've already tried to get the screen coordinate from the geo position but this has the exact same effect.

There are plenty of Map frameworks available on Apple platforms, most notably the multiplatform Mapbox, also allowing things like tiles caching, prebundling with mbtiles files, etc. that empowers a huge set of mapping apps like trip planners, destination guides, and others. At this moment, the only possibility is drawing an externally sourced raster layer over the MapKit content, which is honestly so 2000s today – vectors are definitely the future. :rocket: Thank you!

    Hello! Wayfinding is a critical use case in our app, and we make extensive use of satellite view in both 2D and 3D.  Unfortunately the tiles used in MapKit are woefully out of date (several years old now) and many existing buildings look like construction sites or fields. Is there any way developers can flag regions as needing a new data load? We've tried using the built in location feedback in Maps but that doesn't seem to result in any improvement. The non-satellite maptypes have the new buildings with proper dimensions and we're happy about that, but we really would like for all types to be accurate.

We do have limit for how close your camera can get to the ground and unfortunately you cannot override that value.</p>
<p>|U03JUASCSN8|:

Interesting ... so opening the maps url will open the Maps app on the device? Also, will this solution work for iOS16 devices only?</p>

Will do :relaxed:</p>
<p>[Just jumped into a Lab, back now]</p>
<p>Just to check: does the URL scheme (multiple <code>daddr</code> parameters) also work in CarPlay, or solely on the ‘main device’ itself? (To launch into a multi-stop route)</p>
<p>|U03JEAKCY6L|:
Calling <code>-openURL:...</code> on your CarPlay app's UIScene will open Maps on the CarPlay screen, while calling it on the phone UIScene will open Maps on the phone. Note that CarPlay only supports the driving transport type</p>
<p>|U03JEEUJPMJ|:
Ah, to clarify what I meant: is it just Maps <em>on iPhone</em> that supports the multiple <code>daddr</code> parameters for multi-stop routing, or does Maps in CarPlay also handle a multi-stop <a href="http://maps.apple.com|maps.apple.com">http://maps.apple.com|maps.apple.com</a> URL? (Gracias!)</p>
<p>(/ In my CarPlay app, I currently launch Maps in CarPlay with a <em>single destination</em>, but I’ve love to be able to launch Maps in CarPlay with a multi-stop route, and just want to confirm that’s doable at the moment. Unsure if that multiple <code>daddr</code> parameter functionality is available in CarPlay too)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J36CBE49|:
Hello! While there’s currently no way to <em>truly</em> mutate/animate overlays, you <em>can</em> animate several properties of the standard <code>MKOverlayRenderer</code> subclasses. Specifically, you can change things like <code>MKOverlayPathRenderer.fillColor</code>, <code>MKOverlayPathRenderer.strokeColor</code>, <code>MKOverlayPathRenderer.lineWidth</code>, <code>MKPolylineRenderer.strokeStart</code>, <code>MKPolylineRenderer.strokeEnd</code>, and more from within a <code>UIView</code> animation block, and the resulting change will animate accordingly.</p>
<p><code>strokeStart</code> and <code>strokeEnd</code> in particular can be used to achieve some pretty dynamic effects, such as “revealing” a line from start to finish (similar to the effect you see when <a href="http://Maps.app|Maps.app">http://Maps.app|Maps.app</a> first displays a route.</p>

<p>|U03HQGPJ1U3|:
SwiftUI's <code>Map</code> does not currently support Overlays. Platforms with <code>MKMapView</code> can use <code>UIViewRepresentable</code> to add Overlay content. MapKit does not currently offer Overlay support on WatchOS.</p>

<p>|U03J21CNQ1G|:
Hey &lt;@U03JCQQ5CRJ&gt;, not an Apple Engineer, but reckon I could help. I had actually integrated an overlay in my Apple Watch app through a slightly hacky way before.

<p>|U03JCQQ5CRJ|:
Clever workaround &lt;@U03J21CNQ1G&gt;, looks like you ran into issues with interactivity :disappointed:</p>
<p>|U03J21CNQ1G|:
yup thats the unfortunate part</p>
<p>|U03JCQQ5CRJ|:
How were you able to convert from map coordinates to screen coordinates without the <code>MKMapView.convert()</code> functions?</p>
<p>|U03J21CNQ1G|:
i remember though, as long as the transparent annotations remain on screen its fine to move around a little</p>
<p>|U03J21CNQ1G|:
&lt;@U03JCQQ5CRJ&gt;, I used GeometryReader to provide me the frame info of each of the transparent anotations</p>
<p>|U03J21CNQ1G|:
from then on you can position it via that by computing things like size and screen coordinate</p>
<p>|U03JCQQ5CRJ|:
Nice! I'll poke around and see if I can put together something usable, thanks for the tips</p>

<p>|U03JRR3H0DN|:
Actually I think my issue is that the public API I'm using does not use that tile size so they appear too large. A <code>tileSize</code> parameter in the tile overlay would solve this for me.</p>

Your WMTS server may only have data at 256px, which means you are data limited.  Meaning all they serve is 1x (usually 256 px at 96 ppi).  For retina displays you typically want the 2x (usually 512 px at 192 ppi).  This is not limited to WMTS.</p>

My thinking was, I could somehow make the tiles smaller on screen, similar to how MKTileOverlay size can be set with tileSize property</p>
<p>|U03JRR3H0DN|:
But I'll submit an enhancement request for it with more details :slightly_smiling_face::+1:</p>
<p>|U03JPSJS03E|:
Another thought:   Check with your WMTS server admin if they can serve up <code>WGS84_Pseudo-Mercator/14/4617/9275@2x.png</code>  or something similar.</p>
<p>|U03JRR3H0DN|:
I can ask but I don't think that's part of the WMTS spec, not sure though</p>
<p>|U03HHUG7ZD4|:
&lt;@U03JRR3H0DN&gt; References to MapKit interfaces will be helpful for a MapKit JS enhancement request.</p>
<p>|U03JRR3H0DN|:
maybe these screenshots also better visualize the issue. at the same zoom level one will be pixel accurate where the other won't</p>
<p>|U03JRR3H0DN|:
I'm using the same WMTS API in both, my iOS app and my website, but I can only set the tileSize for the iOS app</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H3M7UAP9|:
Hi! This is an expected behavior. In globe map, <code>MKPolyline</code> and <code>MKGeodesicPolyline</code> are rendered as <em>rasters</em>. Thus, if the polyline is crossing tiles with different <em>z</em> (map tile zoom level) you’ll see different width, as we compute raster polyline width using the <em>z</em> value.</p>
<p>It’s possible that adjacent map tiles are at different zoom levels. Tile zoom level is determined using camera position, e.g the distance between tile and the camera.</p>

Hi! Currently there is no work around for globe map :grimacing: All overlays on globe map are rendered as rasters. Sorry about that. I’m not sure about your use case….. but you’ll definitely get more options if you use the standard map.</p>

Not as great as native support <code>MKMapView</code> clustering but it is possible to write your own pin clustering on top of SwiftUI <code>Map</code> . I did this last year using <code>QuadTrees</code>, observing the <code>mapRect</code> and looping over regions to cluster.</p>

Yes I spoke once with a Apple engineer from another team who did something similar.

Hello Talby!</p>
<p>Changing the visible map region of an <code>MKMapView</code> to show two points can be done as the following...</p>
<pre><code>// these are your two lat/long coordinates
CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate1 = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(lat1,long1);
CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate2 = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(lat2,long2);

// convert them to MKMapPoint
MKMapPoint p1 = MKMapPointForCoordinate (coordinate1);
MKMapPoint p2 = MKMapPointForCoordinate (coordinate2);

// and make a MKMapRect using mins and spans
MKMapRect mapRect = MKMapRectMake(fmin(p1.x,p2.x), fmin(p1.y,p2.y), fabs(p1.x-p2.x), fabs(p1.y-p2.y));

[mapView setVisibleMapRect:mapRect animated:YES];
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for your question!</p>
<p>|U03JQV7JC76|:
So this is what i’m already doing, unfortunately if you have two things on opposite sides of the map and your map is in portrait, this will cause it to not show either and rather center the map filling the mapView. I’m wondering if there’s either a way to not force the mapView to fill, or if there’s an easy way to detect when this happens so externally i can change the aspect ratio of the mapView</p>
<p>|U03JQV7JC76|:
example of the issue</p>
<p>|U03HSU2HNUU|:
Hi Talby, unfortunately there is no easy way to accomplish what you want to do. You may be able to convert <code>MKMapPoints</code> to screen coordinates to do things like determine if the point is offscreen or how to change the aspect ratio of your view to account for the two distant points.</p>

Hello Talby, the aspect ratio of the map is not an available value. However you may be able to use <code>-[MKMapView mapRectThatFits:]</code> as the returned <code>MKMapRect</code> is modified to fit the aspect ratio of the map.</p>

Wayfinding is a critical use case in our app, and we make extensive use of satellite view in both 2D and 3D.  Unfortunately the tiles used in MapKit are woefully out of date (several years old now) and many existing buildings look like construction sites or fields. Is there any way developers can flag regions as needing a new data load? We've tried using the built in location feedback in Maps but that doesn't seem to result in any improvement. The non-satellite maptypes have the new buildings with proper dimensions and we're happy about that, but we really would like for all types to be accurate.</h4>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HQGPJ1U3|:
Hi Michael!</p>
<p>You could eliminate the <code>UIView</code> snapshotting step by adding the SwiftUI hosting view as a subview of an <code>MKAnnotationView</code> subclass. If your annotation content is static, the simplicity of your <code>UIImage</code>-based approach could be preferable, depending on the specifics of your use case.</p>

<p>|U03J1TN6WBD|:
Should either solutions have about the same performance as in using UIKit ?</p>
<p>|U03JEEUJPMJ|:
Thanks &lt;@U03HQGPJ1U3&gt; – in my quest to get <em>something</em> working; I think I tried, as suggested, adding a SwiftUI hosting view as an <code>MKAnnotationView</code> subclass, but had issues with the SwiftUI view being:
• vertically ‘pushed down’, with empty space above
• the bottom cut off (by the same vertical amount as the empty space at the top)
It seems that there’s an issue relating to <code>UIHostingController</code> and <code>safeAreaInsets</code>: the vertical ‘pushing down’ seemed to always be the exact height of the device-top’s <code>safeAreaInsets</code> (for the notch, on iPhone X and newer, for example). I was able to work around this when converting to a <code>UIImage</code>, but couldn’t find a workaround -at the time- when using annotation views directly.</p>
<p>I’ll try again (<code>MKAnnotationView</code> subclass with a hosting controller subview), and if the same ‘cut-off’ behaviour occurs, I’ll file feedback specific to the <code>safeAreaInsets</code> issue.</p>
<p>(Screenshots speak a thousand words, and all that jazz, but I can’t easily dig up screenshots I took at the time, right this moment)</p>
<p>I’ll separately file an enhancement request :relaxed:</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HJ92E4E6|:
Hi Erick, thank you for your question!</p>
<p>Yes, the Look Around view controller can be presented in fullscreen directly.</p>
<p>If you are using storyboards, just add a push segue to your Look Around View Controller scene.</p>
<p>If you are using code, you could have code like the following in the action handler of a <code>UIButton</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{
    let coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: xxx, longitude: yyy) // the location to display
    let lookAroundViewController = MKLookAroundViewController()
    view.present(lookAroundViewController, animated: true)
    let request = MKLookAroundSceneRequest(coordinate: coordinate)
    Task {
        do {
            if let scene = try await request.scene {
                lookAroundViewController.scene = scene
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that is a fairly simple implementation that doesn’t verify that the specified coordinate does indeed support an <code>MKLookAroundScene</code>.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would have retrieved the scene ahead of time and only show the Show Look Around button if you know you have a scen to display.</p>

Hey &lt;@U03J4D7EZNY&gt;, thank you for your question. Could you please clarify which languages your app supports? Is the only localization for French or are there localized strings for other languages? Thank you!</p>

Only French</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HQHD1QLA|:
Hi Ortwin!</p>
<p>It’s possible to achieve a stroked effect similar to the routeline by adding two identical polylines to the map (with different colors), and specifying a wider stroke width for the polyline that you want to represent the stroke.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you want to avoid a rasterized polyline, make sure that both polylines are not using a dashed pattern</p>
<p>|U03J4J6MMK8|:
Thanks. For that I have to copy the polyline from MKRoute. Is that supported? According to the documentation, MKPolyline doesn't conform to NSCopying.</p>
<p>|U03HQHD1QLA|:
Yes, MKPolyline does not support <code>NSCopying</code> at the moment, but that’s a good suggestion for enhancement. You can submit a feedback request for it!</p>
<p>To work around this, you can get the MKPoints that form the polyline with <code>- (MKMapPoint *)points</code>, and pass them in when creating a new <code>MKPolyline</code> with <code>polylineWithPoints</code>. This will do the copying for you.</p>

Thank you Quentin for your question!  Using CLGeocoder vs geocoding via Apple Maps Server API is functionally almost the same. The best option depends on your use case.</p>
<p>If your architecture involves a server-side component already and/or your geocoding results are shared across multiple clients, Apple Maps Server APIs are the way to go.</p>
<p>If your geocoding requests are user-specific and issued at a low rate, you will likely want to stick to CLGeocoder</p>

For instance is it measured per Maps ID, per Developer Account, or some other context?  If we were to use ID/Key for each of our clients, could we create them on their behalf under our Developer Accout?

Thanks David for your question. We are excited to see how you take advantage of these APIs.</p>
<p>The daily quota of 25000 service calls is measured against any service usage via API or MapKitJS calls like search, geocoding, etc.</p>

Hi Lior - Thanks for the question.</p>
<p>What is the annotation and cluster count when the slowness is observed?</p>

If I remember right we found this slowness even on clusters with 2-3 annotations.</p>
<p>In our use case Cluster annotations can be selectable if one of their children is selectable, so we found we have to add a delay in order to be able to select a child annotation after the parent cluster annotation gets removed by the clustering mechanism.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HA09MXN3|:
Hi Michael, do you have a specific use case which requires routing from one side of the highway to the other side?</p>
<p>|U03HA09MXN3|:
It would be great if you could provide some more context, to help us understand the problem</p>
<p>|U03JEEUJPMJ|:
I was working on a route planner for road trips, which would involve adding stops for, among other things, EV charging.  My logic was to follow the overall road trip’s MKRoute polyline, then - when I knew the user’s vehicle would be low on energy - find (from external APIs) a handful of the nearest known-reliable rapid-charging stations.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, most motorway services have a site either side of the motorway; and each site has charging stations.</p>
<p>However: the <em>physically-closest</em> (as a bird flies) charging station is sometimes on the /other side/ of the motorway (e.g. southbound services, even though the user is driving northbound), and would actually require tens of miles of additional driving, coming back on oneself (to go southbound), and then doing the same thing to resume the road trip (northbound).</p>
<p>So, I figured I’d run MKDirections on each of the handful of stations nearby, to get the <em>actual</em> closest stations, based on driving distance and driving time.</p>
<p>However, because MapKit would begin the route from the closest side of the motorway seemingly each time, this wasn’t doable.</p>
<p>(Hopefully that conveys what I mean, but I realise that my explanation is inherently fairly convoluted :see_no_evil:)</p>
<p>|U03JEEUJPMJ|:
Correction: “However, because MapKit would begin each route from [the side of the motorway physically-closest to each charging station]  seemingly each time, this wasn’t doable.”</p>

<p>This year we focused on expanding our features on various other platforms which can be viewed at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10035/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10035/</a>. While we are continuously working on enriching our features, we are always listening for feedback. Are there specific improvements you are looking for Maps on watchOS?</p>
<p>Please file an enhancement request via <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/|Feedback Assistant">https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/|Feedback Assistant</a>.
If possible, please describe both your technical requirements and a description of your use case so we can better serve your needs.</p>
<p>Feel free to provide a feedback ID in this thread so that we can reference it later.</p>
