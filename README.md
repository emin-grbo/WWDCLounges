# WWDC 22
*[...in progress]*

This year we came prepared and saved all the lounges. It will take a bit to format all the questions and possibly deliver the info in a new way.

In case you want to be notified on the progress, find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emin_ui), or start the repo ⭐️

If you want the raw JSON files, get in touch, but I will be posting them all here once a definite approach on formatting is formed.
