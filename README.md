# WWDCLounges

### An archive of questions asked during WWDC Lounges. 🙌
- _Forks/suggestions welcomed 🙌_

# WWDC 21
For WWDC 2021 lounges we only saved 3, visit the pages [LINK](https://roblack.github.io/WWDCLounges)

# WWDC 22
*[...in progress]*

This year we came prepared and saved all the lounges. It will take a bit to format all the questions and possibly deliver the info in a new way.

In case you want to be notified on the progress, find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emin_ui), or start the repo ⭐️
