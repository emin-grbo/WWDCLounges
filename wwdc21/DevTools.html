    Hi, thank you for organizing this! I have a question about CI, in regards to Xcode Cloud. I remember having troubles (no "std output" was printed anywhere) running certain scripts in Pre-build and post-build actions in Scheme editor when I was using Xcode Server &amp; Bots back in 2015. The question is shall we rely on pre-build action for, say, running things like pod install and other pre-build setup w/o which the project cannot be run?

    I have a question around testing - I was trying to figure out a way to test scenarios around IAP family sharing, either in the simulator using App Store Config files, or even in Sandbox on device.  I can't seem to find a way to simulate something like having a purchase made available via a family purchase made by someone else, or to simulate having a purchase revoked via the head of family disabling family sharing (or someone leaving a family).  Would testing in sandbox on two devices that were set up with family sharing be able to test these scenarios?  Was also wondering about generating server to server notifications for those events as well, but even just being able to test in Xcode would be helpful.

    Could Xcode Cloud be used as a platform to eventually add distributed build/cache systems? We're very interested in the ability to do use this to speed up developer builds. Build systems like Bazel have powerful capabilities here, but with poor Xcode integration and increased complexity for developers. We would love to see this problem solved natively using Xcode and is a major pain point.

When we were just producing static frameworks, we could drop several of our projects into a common workspace and it was easy to debug right into each of those frameworks -- Xcode figures out that since the Foo project builds the Foo framework, other projects in the workspace should link against that. We'd really like to do the same thing with our XCFrameworks, but they don't seem to be supported as well.

    I have a question around testing - I was trying to figure out a way to test scenarios around IAP family sharing, either in the simulator using App Store Config files, or even in Sandbox on device.  I can't seem to find a way to simulate something like having a purchase made available via a family purchase made by someone else, or to simulate having a purchase revoked via the head of family disabling family sharing (or someone leaving a family).  Would testing in sandbox on two devices that were set up with family sharing be able to test these scenarios?  Was also wondering about generating server to server notifications for those events as well, but even just being able to test in Xcode would be helpful.

    My team produces a number of software components, and we've recently switched from packaging them as static frameworks to XCFrameworks. Xcode doesn't have a target type for producing XCFrameworks (please tell me that I'm wrong!), so that packaging happens in a post-archive script. When we were just producing static frameworks, we could drop several of our projects into a common workspace and it was easy to debug right into each of those frameworks -- Xcode figures out that since the Foo project builds the Foo framework, other projects in the workspace should link against that. We'd really like to do the same thing with our XCFrameworks, but they don't seem to be supported as well. Is there something we can do to debug into our XCFrameworks when their respective projects are all in a workspace together?

I have a question about CI, in regards to Xcode Cloud. I remember having troubles (no "std output" was printed anywhere) running certain scripts in Pre-build and post-build actions in Scheme editor when I was using Xcode Server &amp; Bots back in 2015. The question is shall we rely on pre-build action for, say, running things like <code>pod install</code> and other pre-build setup w/o which the project cannot be run?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Xcode Cloud supports custom CI-specific build scripts that are distinct from pre-build action scripts in your Xcode scheme. The logging from these scripts is captured and made available in your workflow results. See some documentation about this here:
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-custom-build-scripts</p>

<p>Xcode Cloud will allow you to re-run a failed job. Which tests get run will depend on how you configured your test plan, and if you enabled a test repetition mode (New in Xcode 13!) in your test plans. Xcode Cloud always respects your test plan/scheme and workflow configuration</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I found is that as long as Xcode outputs a dSYM, it will be included in the artifacts.  For more advanced workflows, you could use Xcode Cloud’s environment variables with a custom build script to extract symbols from an archive and upload them to a place of your choosing.
More specifically, take a look at <code>CI_ARCHIVE_PATH</code> and <code>ci_post_xcodebuild.sh</code>.</p>

I can't seem to find a way to simulate something like having a purchase made available via a family purchase made by someone else, or to simulate having a purchase revoked via the head of family disabling family sharing (or someone leaving a family).  Would testing in sandbox on two devices that were set up with family sharing be able to test these scenarios?  Was also wondering about generating server to server notifications for those events as well, but even just being able to test in Xcode would be helpful.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you been using StoreKit to test this? This documentation seems related to what you're asking for: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/supporting_family_sharing_in_your_app</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a great session from WWDC2020 around StoreKit Testing with Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10659/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks, I've develop my code to handle the scenarios outlined in that document, I'm more wondering how I can trigger those in simulator testing...  for example, if I'm running in the Xcode simulator, is there any StoreKit testing feature that would trigger the <code>paymentQueue(_:didRevokeEntitlementsForProductIdentifiers:)</code> method of <code>SKPaymentTransactionObserver</code>?  I'd like to be able to test my code to make sure my handling of that method works correctly.  That document also mentions a REVOKE server to server notification, when testing in Sandbox is there any way to generate that event?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the followup.  For the server to server notification, unfortunately not.  Please file a feedback ticket for us to add that functionality (and add a followup here with the FB# if you have time to do so now).   For the first case, yes!  After a purchase is made, open the StoreKit Transaction Manager (Debug &gt; StoreKit &gt; Manage Transactions), you can select a transaction and refund it.  This will cause <code>paymentQueue(_:didRevokeEntitlementsForProductIdentifiers:)</code> to be called within your app.</p>

<p>Will Xcode Cloud allow us to use classic open source tools in the Swift ecosystem (like swiftlint or sourcery) in our workflows ? How will version dependency be managed ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, Xcode Cloud has ways for you to use open source tools in your workflows, so you can do things like lint or statically generate code in the cloud if you wanted to.</p>

<p>Check out this documentation on writing custom scripts for Xcode Cloud to see how to get started!</p>
<p>As for how your versioned dependencies will be managed, that would be handled by whatever dependency manager your project uses. So if you use Swift Package Manager, then your build step would resolve the dependencies and versions according to how you wrote your Package.swift  file.</p>

<p>I have one question that I couldn't resolve by going through the docs though (sorry if it's already answered there). Basically, I'd like to know if workflows can be triggered on demand through an API the same way it can be done with some App Store Connect actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, Xcode Cloud will be fully integrated into the App Store Connect public REST API. You will be able to start new builds programmatically.
The public REST API integration is not immediately available today, but will be released during the summer.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>For context on one typical use case: apps that have not only a frontend component but also have backend server components require integration testing when the backend systems change. When the backend system has passed server side tests, you can set up programmatic triggers using the API to invoke Xcode Cloud builds and tests from an upstream pipeline using a specified staging server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will a workflow be always tied to an App Store listing? Can a project be built (using REST API) without its app ID being registered in App Store Connect?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes a workflow is always associated with an App listing in App Store Connect. Creating a workflow in Xcode streamlines the creation of App Store Connect records. If the App Store Connect record already exists, then these will be associated automatically, based on the bundle ID in your project.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For general, self maintained CI/CD xcodebuild is your best friend. The "Testing in Xcode" session from WWDC19 hits on some best practices that may be useful to you: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/413/
Some points I'd like to highlight from the session:
- The testing pyramid, to help strike the right balance between unit, integration, and UI tests
- Using test plans efficiently for the variables you want to change between test runs
- What configuration works best for your needs when planning CI/CD set up. At times it is useful to have a separate builder machine from test runner, in which case you'll break your executions into build-for-testing and test-without-building, but it really depends on your use case</p>

<p>Yes it does! See the Custom Environment Variables section on this page:

</blockquote>
<p>You can add secret environment variables to a workflow. They are "write-only", meaning that once set, secret environment variables cannot be read again from the workflow editor. Secret environment variables are encrypted in transit and at rest, and used only on the ephemeral build environment. As such they are suitable for AWS keys, passwords, and API tokens.  You can also add "non-secret" environment variables, which can be read and edited from the workflow editor.</p>

When the compiler analyzes a switch statement for exhaustiveness, it has some heuristics for very large enums that are intended to keep compiler performance good even in the face of complex patterns with very large sets of enum cases, but it can lead to false-negative cases when that goes wrong. If you have a moment to try to extract some of your code into a test case, and submit an issue to bugs.swift.org, we might be able to use it to further refine these heuristics. Thanks for letting us know about the issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This question was answered earlier, but I'll answer it again.
Right now the supported deployment target is iOS 15, macOS Monterey, etc., or later.  This is because of enhancements to Dispatch to support Swift concurrency, of which the concurrency runtime uses.  We are actively exploring the possibility of backward deployment, but are mindful of not compromising the future of concurrency performance by doing so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Creating an instance of an actor type is no more costly than creating an instance of a class type. It's only during the access of an actor's protected state that a task suspension may happen, to switch to that actor's executor. The implementation of that switching is lightweight, and is optimized by both the compiler and runtime system.

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, you can launch either of the forms of unstructured task from sync code. In Xcode beta 1, there is <code>async { }</code>, which will start a new async task that runs on the same actor as the launching context (which can be important if that's the MainActor, for main-thread-bound UI work), and <code>asyncDetached { }</code>, which will start a completely independent task. If you've been following Swift open source, though, you may know that these names have been revised due to feedback from the open source community; they're known as <code>Task</code> and <code>Task.detached</code> currently.</p>

<p>A member of my team is building a tool to create unified output from several disparate docs generators that we use across different language-specific SDKs.

I'd love to use DocC for the in-Xcode documentation, if I could also then feed DocC's output into our custom tool to unify reference docs on our docs site for our users. Having a spec for DocC's output, or being able to theme it, would go a long way toward enabling that unified experience.

<p>When you use the Build Documentation menu in Xcode, the doccarchive does go into the derived data directory, so if you clear that, you would have to rebuild the docs.

<p>Thanks for the great question! We have a helpful command line tool for Simulators that you can run via <code>xcrun simctl</code> that can do a lot of useful automation and setup.

If you find functionality missing from simctl, please do submit feedback through Feedback Assistant!! Also, one thing that you might try if you're doing this often... You can run all of your setup steps on a Simulator device, shut it down, then make a clone of that device with <code>xcrun simctl clone</code>, and then use that cloned device for testing. This might also be a good question to discuss with one of our Simulator engineers in our labs, so if that sounds like it would be helpful to you, please visit https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/labs , search for Simulator in the "Search WWDC21 labs..." field, and request an appointment.

<p>I believe issues like this occur in CI systems where "fresh" hosts are instantiated for each job.
I've observed performance issues due to <code>update_dyld_sim_shared_cache</code> running after booting a simulator for the first time — which on CI tends to coincide when attempting to run a test suite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the follow-up! I think it might still be helpful to request a lab appointment with one of our Simulator engineers to talk through the issues here. It’s difficult to recommend a good solution without having a better understanding of all the issues. :) If the bottleneck you’re seeing is resource constraints because the dyld shared cache is being built at the same time as your tests are running, you could try adding to your CI scripting to build the dyld shared cache first, allow that to complete, and then run your UI tests after. You can do this by running <code>xcrun simctl runtime update_dyld_shared_cache</code>. Please note that this command is not currently documented externally and is subject to change. If this command is helpful to you, please file a Feedback Report and ask for this functionality to be made more broadly available. If it would be helpful to have a flag for <code>xcrun simctl boot</code> which changed the behavior to wait until the shared cache is generated before booting the device, please file a Feedback Report for that as well. Again, it’s hard to make a good recommendation without a full understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve, and the best way to do that would be to request a lab appointment as mentioned above. Hope this helps!!</p>

<p>What are some neat benefits of writing and running full iOS/iPadOS apps on iPad that may not be immediately obvious without having experienced using the app?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an incredible question!
Making iPadOS apps right on the iPad is an incredible experience. It's easy to get a feel for how your app will behave as a part of the amazing iPadOS system experience like when in fullscreen, a multitasking split size, and in slide over.
You can test out how your app responds to a software keyboard present and how it changes when you attach a  hardware keyboard. You can check how your UI responds to hover effects with the trackpad, and you can test out great gestures right in the canvas with your finger(s)!
We're so excited to see what y'all come up with when working in Swift Playgrounds 4. If any of these things spark inspiration or excitement about Playgrounds, we'd love to hear your desires and expectations via feedback!</p>

<p>It sounds like you have two separate thin (single-architecture) binaries, one for each arch, but both for the simulator. XCFrameworks don't support that; there needs to be only a single multi-arch binary.

<p>There is not a way to see individual watchdog crashes in the Xcode Organizer. However the new Terminations metric in Xcode 13 will show you aggregated data about all types of terminations that customers are experiencing in your app.
Searching by the content of a stack trace is not available in the Organizer, but this would be a great enhancement to request via Feedback Assistant!
In Xcode 13, you can see up to 1000 of your app's crashes for the past year, so you can view and investigate far more than the top 25 crashes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Xcode Cloud can greatly add value, even for individual developers. It can easily help you validate the code you write by starting integration jobs that will also run your tests on multiple run destinations (i.e. iOS/iPadOS simulator, Mac Catalyst) in addition to building. This way, you will feel more confident about your work when shipping updates of your App (it also handles code-signing for you).
With Xcode Cloud, your project is ready to accept outside contributions without needing to maintain a CI infrastructure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I am looking at a new crash in an area I am not familiar with, one of the first things I do is try to understand <em>why</em> it is crashing. Asking yourself questions can also help you get a quick understanding of what kind of crash it is. "Is it crashing because I made an assumption I shouldn't be?" "Is this framework I am using expecting something different than what I am giving it?" "Does this only happen sometimes?"
Answering those questions can get you started on understand the crash and then working towards a fix!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the Organizer's inspector allows me to see how big of a problem it is. It can tell me all about how many devices this crash is happening on, what versions of the OS, and new this year,: where is it crashing (App Store or TestFlight) and which app versions?</p>

<p>You can configure Xcode to use the system git instead of the builtin one, which is what SwiftPM uses on the command line.

<blockquote>
<p>Starting Swift 5.4, Swift Package Manager caches package dependencies on a per-user basis, which reduces the amount of network traffic and increases performance of dependency resolution for subsequent uses of the same package. This means that while the initial clone may still be slow depending on the repository size, subsequent clones are much faster. This can also be used in CI by configuring the cache location.

<p>There's not a convenient command to do this yet. As a workaround, you could perform an update, then revert your <code>Package.resolved</code> file to its prior state with your source control system to go back to your old dependency versions.</p>

<h4 id="can-static-analyzer-in-xcode-13-find-dead-code-like-unused-variables-and-methods">Can Static Analyzer in Xcode 13 find dead code like unused variables and methods?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Xcode provides compiler warnings for unused local variables and unused static functions and unused C++ private methods. There are no warnings for unused Objective-C methods because in Objective-C it's a fairly hard technical problem as it's a very dynamic language. The static analyzer provides additional warnings for problems that require deeper analysis such as unused initializations or assignments that get immediately overwritten ("dead stores") and redundant if-clauses and operands in expressions (new in this release! - off by default, see the "Unused Code" section in build settings).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do Static Analyzer works with Swift?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The static analyzer can detect bugs in C/C++ and ObjC code. It doesn’t detect bugs in Swift code. However, you can use the analyzer on mixed Swift-ObjC projects. We recommend running the analyzer on your project if it has C/C++ or ObjC code as some issues the analyzer can detect on ObjC code can manifest as hard-to-find bugs when used from Swift.</p>

If so, can I configure which frameworks to exclude?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a great question! The static analyzer will analyze all third party code as long as it's getting compiled when you're building your app (i.e., binary frameworks aren't analyzed) and it's written in a language supported by the static analyzer (i.e. C/C++/Objective-C but not Swift). There is no way to exclude individual frameworks but given that the source code is available, you may have a chance to edit it to suppress unwanted warnings.</p>
