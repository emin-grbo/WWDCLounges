    In our app running iOS 14.x, we used UISegmentedControl. I've noticed that when scaling for bigger dynamic font the UISegmentedControl stays the same size and doesn't reflect the accessibility font trait. The same happens in iOS 14.x app "Phone" - "Last calls" tab. Because of that I had to build own UIControl that would mimic the UISegmentedControl. Here's the question, since the minimal tappable size according to Human Interface Guidelines should be 44x44 pt and the mentioned UISegmentControl doesn't scale more than 32pt on height, isn't this an accessibility issue? Is there a solution that I maybe missing? :)

My concern is the accessibility label being too different to the original string, especially when the equations get a little more complicated and I would need to add many commas to an accessibility label to make the operations clear.

    Just a quick question. I have a free watchOS complication called Roughly; it's on the App Store now. It tells the approximate time in words, in many languages, but I'm not a good programmer! It would be great to see this rolled into watchOS properly by Apple; some people who suffer from dyscalculia use this to tell time without reading numbers. Supporting many more languages is a tricky problem too, as different countries tell time in very different ways. Also, I've got a minor issue with VoiceOver. Although the one-line complications are read out correctly when tapped, the three-line complication is not — only the first line (e.g. "It's about" instead of "It's about ten to three") is read out. Any ideas why that might be?

    What would be ideal experience from auto capture perspective and Voice Over? We have SDK where one of the entry point allows user to change between Auto Capture and Manual Capture.  If person who needs accessibility starts screen with auto capture enabled, our logic announces detecting object and captures it. Sometimes its too fast and doesn't allow breathing room to let user understand what is happening. Any Suggestion?

    I had a question related to languages. I have a Dutch soccer app (with a lot of Dutch names and terms). We know that we have some users that use Voice over and have their system language set to English. Other then forcing the accessibility language to dutch, is there a better way to let the system and user know the app is in Dutch? Translating the entire app to English wouldn't help much because of all the dutch names and their pronunciations.

    This is excellent. It is absolutely relevant to my app, it's just the dogs are people. :) This gets at a challenge I have as a sighted developer. I use VoiceOver myself for some functional tasks, such as reading out content I'd rather hear than read myself. But it is hard to get to know the deeper layers of VoiceOver. One key third party app for teaching even the main VoiceOver gestures and interactions has been discontinued. What resources do you recommend for people to learn good interaction patterns for VoiceOver beyond the surface level?

    In our app running iOS 14.x, we used UISegmentedControl.

The same happens in iOS 14.x app "Phone" - "Last calls" tab. Because of that I had to build own UIControl that would mimic the UISegmentedControl. Here's the question, since the minimal tappable size according to Human Interface Guidelines should be 44x44 pt and the mentioned UISegmentControl doesn't scale more than 32pt on height, isn't this an accessibility issue?

    Just a quick question. I have a free watchOS complication called Roughly; it's on the App Store now. It tells the approximate time in words, in many languages, but I'm not a good programmer! It would be great to see this rolled into watchOS properly by Apple; some people who suffer from dyscalculia use this to tell time without reading numbers. Supporting many more languages is a tricky problem too, as different countries tell time in very different ways. Also, I've got a minor issue with VoiceOver. Although the one-line complications are read out correctly when tapped, the three-line complication is not — only the first line (e.g. "It's about" instead of "It's about ten to three") is read out. Any ideas why that might be?

<h4 id="as-a-relatively-new-ios-developer-what-should-i-keep-in-mind-for-developing-more-accessible-apps">As a relatively new iOS developer, what should I keep in mind for developing more accessible apps?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a great question! For starters, I’d familiarize myself with Voice Over. Spend some time with it and get an idea of how to use it. Once you do, you’ll start to get a feel for what would work well with it. If you’re into SwiftUI, you’ll find that the accessibility modifiers are simple tools that can do a ton of work. Likewise, UIKit offers the same functionality with UIAccessibility. I encourage you to dig into some of the documentation to see what you can find.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>My recommendation for new iOS devs is to stick as much as possible to native components as they're accessible out of the box. You may start running into problems when developing custom components and I would do that only if necessary, and as Adrian says, if you are familiar with UIAccessibility and the SwiftUI accessibility modifiers available.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-some-of-the-best-practices-of-testing-for-accessibility">What are some of the best practices of testing for accessibility?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>That depends on what part of accessibility you want to test, I guess.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally I (and my team) test Voice Over and swipe navigation on a physical device with VO turned on, the screen turned black (triple tap with three fingers) and head phones on (so my peers won’t beat me up)
Dynamic font sizes and responsive layout I test inside the simulator changing accessibility settings in Xcode.
But there is so much more to accessibility than this. Having a clean, straightforward design and using default views, controls and so on will do the heavy lifting for you in most situations.
A crucial part is to find people that rely on accessibility features and get them to test your app for you. Creating a test group that is diverse is key here. It can be hard to get those especially for independent developers, I guess.
So the least you can do is to give them the ability to send you feedback on your app’s accessibility and make this way of giving feedback as accessible as possible.</p>

<h4 id="hi-i-have-some-questions-about-voiceover">Hi, I have some questions about voiceover:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Voiceover read all of the contents in table view cell. I found the only way to turn it off is to set the accessibility label to empty string for the cell. Is there any other way?</li>
<li>How to prevent voiceover keep reading the contents in fast updating view?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you trying to exclude only specific contents from your table cell? One option might be to make the cell itself an accessibility element so that it doesn’t expose its children, and then override <code>accessibilityLabel</code> on the cell. Then any controls within the cell you can expose via <code>accessibilityCustomActions</code>. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615150-accessibilitycustomactions
You can probably use the <code>updatesFrequently</code> trait for this: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibility/uiaccessibilitytraits/1620187-updatesfrequently</p>

<h4 id="hello-some-slightly-in-the-weeds-questions-but-things-ive-never-quite-figured-out">Hello! Some slightly in the weeds questions, but things I've never quite figured out :)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Why do all <code>NSObjects</code> implement accessibility features such as <code>accessibilityLabel</code> etc, rather than just starting with <code>UIView</code>?</li>
<li>Why is <code>accessibilityIdentifier</code> part of <code>UIAccessibility</code>?  I understand its purpose is for identifying the view for UI Testing, but I'm unclear on the accessibility connection. Is this used on Mac for tools like automator or for 3rd party assistive tech? Is there any use for this on iOS other than UI testing?</li>
<li>Why is there no <code>textField</code> accessibility trait? I suspect the answer to this is obvious :)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>axLabel and friends can be used on many kinds of objects. <code>UIView</code>, <code>CALayers</code>, <code>NSStrings</code> (in the case of <code>UISegments</code>, <code>SpriteKit</code> nodes and many more)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost all automation relies on the accessibility runtime system to provide its information. When no axIdentifier is present, it falls back to axLabel. So that is the connection at least.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great question! When your app uses the Core Haptics Framework, iOS will handle the delivery of haptics based on the user’s setting for System Haptics. You don’t need to worry about accidentally breaking this setting. For devices that don’t support Core Haptics, like iPads and iPods, you can check the device’s capability and use that to make decisions about what kind of feedback to give to the user.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>VoiceOver actually implements an entire set of its own haptics that work system-wide so it may be the case that an app’s haptics could conflict with VoiceOver and cause confusion for a user.
One idea might be to offer the ability to turn your app haptics off if VoiceOver users find the combined experience to be overwhelming</p>

<p>I understand that in general the most efficient approach is to extract meaning from the views hierarchy and find an alternative way to translate it for the user to understand. For example rendering it using speech in VoiceOver instead of using pixels in the screen.</p>
<p>But these kind of apps essentially are interactive dashboards with controls that may not hold a hierarchical relationship. And I'm wondering if it would make sense to think of the whole app UI as a canvas. And try to provide haptic feedback based on the borders and shapes of the controls, so that the users that are not able to see the screen can still explore the canvas and learn the position of the controls using their fingertips.</p>
<p>Do you know of any apps that use a similar approach? How else do you think we could make these apps accessible?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>One thing to consider is that directly touching-to-explore is not the only way to use VoiceOver. Some users perform the discrete gestures like swipe to navigate by element. Other users pair a Braille display and do not touch the screen at all.</p>

<p>Yes. You wouldn't need to use it on something like Button, because we make it accessible by default. But for custom controls, one would often need the "right" value, label, traits and actions.

<p>The AX Inspector is a powerful tool for rapidly iterating, but for determining "is my app really accessible", the best way to do that is to use VoiceOver, especially with a screen curtain on (so you can't see what's on screen). If you can use your app that way, you have done a great job.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s fine to have Accessibility labels that differ a bit from what is on-screen.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The best way to determine what is a good AX label is by trying the app with something like VoiceOver, and getting a sense of what it is like to use it that way. For example, a label might be too long, which might make it difficult to navigate the app. Or it might be not specific enough or clear, where it doesn’t convey enough information to the user.

<p>For example if there is a HUD indicate a loading state, should developer implement special handling for voiceover users by announcing the loading state is still occurring?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best practice here would be to make sure your indicator has an appropriate accessibility label, like "Loading" or "Downloading". If you know the progress of the loading state, you could add an accessibility value like "45%" and include the .updatesFrequently trait.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this a blocking loading state? Can the user interact with your app while this is happening meaningfully?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally, I was thinking of a blocking loading state. But I guess it's applicable to also non-blocking state.
So if a state is non-blocking, and the loading indicator is not interactive, it might make sense just to use an announcement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that is what pull to refresh does. You let the user know they are refreshing, but you don’t need to interrupt their VoiceOver focus, etc.</p>
<p>However, if the loading state is blocking, and certainly if it might be interactive such as allow a cancel action, it would probably make sense to have the VoiceOver user land on the indicator.</p>
<p>Terence, you can use accessibilityRepresentation { ProgressView(...) } as a starting point to make a custom progress view accessible.</p>
<p>If it works in your app, you can also make a custom ProgressViewStyle and use that for your ProgressView. Then you dont need accessibilityRepresentation since you are using ProgressView directly.</p>

<p>That's definitely one approach! If possible stick with a smaller number of cases here though, and if your UI allows, do try to wrap the content in a way that allows the content size to grow without needing to adjust the layout at all</p>

I have a free watchOS complication called Roughly; it's on the App Store now. It tells the approximate time in words, in many languages, but I'm not a good programmer! It would be great to see this rolled into watchOS properly by Apple; some people who suffer from dyscalculia use this to tell time without reading numbers. Supporting many more languages is a tricky problem too, as different countries tell time in very different ways. Also, I've got a minor issue with VoiceOver. Although the one-line complications are read out correctly when tapped, the three-line complication is not — only the first line (e.g. "It's about" instead of "It's about ten to three") is read out. Any ideas why that might be?</h4>

<p>I think you are referring to accessibilityElement(children: ..)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Im not sure I understand your question though. Are you referring to how it works with dynamic number of elements?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes that’s the one I’m referring to. if I understand correctly <code>accessibilityElement(children: ..)</code> is replacing the view hierarchy in VoiceOver with whatever you input as the children, correct?</p>
<p>If so, could there be issues if the view hierarchy inside of accessibilityElement(children: ..) doesn’t match the hierarchy of SwiftUI views for your sighted users?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>zaccessibilityElement(children: )z creates or updates an accessibility elements visibility. Such as, <code>accessibilityElement(children: .contain)</code> would wrap children in an new accessibility container element. Are you perhaps mixing up <code>accessibilityChildren</code>, which allows you to pass in views as children?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No I guess I was misunderstanding the purpose of <code>.accessibilityElement(children: ..)</code></p>
<p>I guess the purpose of it is to add accessibilityChildren if the view doesn’t already have children (like in the example of that custom Canvas View)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes <code>accessibilityChildren</code> is used to add "synthetic" children, which are not directly visible (though could be positioned to match whats drawn in Canvas).</p>
<p><code>accessibilityElement(children: )</code> transforms the exiting accessibility tree, to make a new container or combine child properties into a new element</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to use accessibilityChildren in the use case of replacing the children in the accessibility tree (if the children in the tree are problematic)?</p>

<p>Yes it can be used anywhere. I go more into details in the Beyond the Basics talk: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10119/</p>

<p>should we put the same label in the <code>accessibilityUserInputLabels</code> so the user will say it's name then automatically after the OS will shows the indices or is it better to expose instead the specific cell title for example ? thanks</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would depend on your label and what’s appropriate for it. Generally you should put the name the cell or the relevant content. But if the cell has a super long label, you might want to put something shorter in <code>userInputLabels</code>. Like if it’s a travel app and the cell label is like “New York, a bustling city with tons of nightlife and famous attractions” a good <code>userInputLabel</code> might be just “New York” — this makes it easier to speak.</p>

<p>I think the main question to answer is where in the list of elements should this be placed. Either at the beginning of everything, end of everything or inter-mixed.
