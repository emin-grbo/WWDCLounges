    Suggestion to the designers amongst the SwiftUI folks present:  it would be great if there were more examples of unique user experience interactions, especially navigation, instead of assuming that everyone wants to always use NavigationView as the central UX construct.  UIKit was only slightly better with sparse examples to customize Navigation View transitions, but it too, lacked complete flexibility.  Would love to hear your feedback on this!

    What's the recommended way to share SwiftUI code between multiple platform targets? Recent Xcode multiplatform templates simply make source files members of multiple targets, but a few years ago the recommendation for sharing code between e.g. an app target and an app extension was to create a shared dynamic framework (e.g. MyApp, MyAppExtension and MyAppKit). What would be the pros and cons of either approach?

Not a new document or a confirmation dialog, just "here is some information that makes sense to show right now", such as unlocking an IAP. I've seen hacks with <code>handlesExternalEvents()</code> but it's not very pleasant.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t have much API in this area. A NavigationLink when used within a commands context will open a new window, and as you noted, handlesExternalEvents can be used to, though this is primarily due to the default behavior of that modifier, which is to create a new window for the given scene, if no windows prefer to handle the event. We’d love a feedback for this functionality, and if you can share any specifics of your use case in it, that is even better. Thanks!</p>

UIKit was only slightly better with sparse examples to customize Navigation View transitions, but it too, lacked complete flexibility.  Would love to hear your feedback on this!</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately customizing navigation transitions isn’t supported today — meaning if you want to invent awesome transitions you’ll need to create your own containers and the state that manages them… but you’ll need to ensure your custom goodies properly handle accessibility, common system interactions, and more which can be tricky. Ideally, please file feedback with some use cases or examples for what you have in mind, I would love to see the team take a look at enabling awesome experiences that work well with the system!</p>

<h4 id="is-there-ever-a-case-in-which-spacer-is-superior-to-framemaxwidth-infinityframemaxheight-infinity">Is there ever a case in which Spacer() is superior to .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)/.frame(maxHeight: .infinity)?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Howdy! There was a similar question yesterday about Spacer ‘versus’ frame, check out the answer for how they compare:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Spacer is a view, it doesn't end up displaying anything of its own so it is plenty lightweight. Using .frame can have other behavior introduced to the way the view gets laid out beyond just changing its size. They both have their uses, so use them each where appropriate.</p>
<p>To add a little more onto this, even in cases where you will get almost entirely the same behavior between the two, the performance difference will be so minimal that I would strongly suggest prioritizing code readability over performance / memory use to make this decision. If Spacer makes it more clear what layout you’re trying to specify, use that, and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the gist is: they both have their purposes and are extremely efficient from a performance perspective. So, you should focus on what your intention is and which reads better or offers the functionality you’re trying to utilize as you construct your hierarchies</p>

We only have <code>Color.background</code> as opposed to the main varying alternatives, and it's annoying to have to wrap them repeatedly.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A goal for us is that the Color and other API we provide works great on all platforms. So there are often other APIs to help get those effects: for instance GroupBox on iOS will produce the stacking (secondary and so on) system background colors, and on macOS gives you a similar effect but using the more platform appropriate group box (9-part) artwork instead of colors at all. The new .primary, .secondary, .tertiary, .quaternary shape styles are similar in that they also work across platforms and now can correctly give the correct vibrant rendering effect on top of materials
So while we might not add a Color for everything that UIKit has, we do want to make sure we have coverage for those design concepts. (so specific feedbacks on things that are missing are always appreciated!)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Things like label , secondaryLabel, etc are all achievable using those shape styles above and are even smarter in those material contexts, i.e. .foregroundStyle(.secondary)</p>

Additionally, you should take a look at the new TimelineView and replace your use of Timer here. It’s not recommended to declare new objects in your view’s initializer without a @StateObject or @ObservedObject property wrapper, if you must use a Timer, store it inside an ObservableObject that you can refer to as a StateObject, or another similar technique. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both have their uses, and it depends on the architecture you’re building. If you have one (or a few) large ObservableObjects that large parts of the view hierarchy need to see, I would generally recommend EnvironmentObject as SwiftUI can look at which of your views depend on the EnvironmentObject and only invalidate those when your ObservableObject changes (you can get this behavior with ObservedObject too, but it’s more cumbersome). Plus, views that don’t actually use the ObservableObject don’t get cluttered with code relating to it.
That said, if your model is, for example, an object graph that is largely not structured based on your view hierarchy, it may make more sense to use ObservedObject to grab pieces of that model out to use in your view.</p>

<p>Thank you!
As long as the identity of the timeline is the same, and the value of the schedule didn’t change based on the body update, it shouldn’t trigger a new update of the contained Canvas.

<p>Many of the customizations you see are part of the default styling that lets you have the most natural feeling UI by default. However, most of these default stylings should be overridable by using the same modifiers you would to get that style.
For example, if you want to remove the default capitalization of the section header, you can use the text case modifier:</p>

<h4 id="hello">Hello,</h4>
<p>Is it possible to have a simultaneous DragGesture in an inner view of a ScrollView which doesn't make the ScrollView drag gesture fail?
The DragGesture has a minimumDistance of 0.
It seems it's impossible to scroll the scrollView if the DragGesture is recognized (it's installed as simultaneous and the GestureMask is <code>.all</code>).
Is there a workaround?
Thanks!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Howdy! Great question, this is a great case where we could use feedback from you to better understand how folks use-cases vary with gestures and ScrollView. In the meantime, a possible workaround would be to use a UIViewRepresentable where you can wrap a UIScrollView and get access to all its goodies and expose any functionality you need to your SwiftUI hierarchy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Howdy! Using a GeometryReader in a background of a view ensures the GeometryReader doesn’t grow to be larger than that containing view, but it makes it tricky to bubble its size out. You could do something like this:
struct ContentView: View {
  @State private var height = 100.0
  var body: some View {
    MyView().background {
       GeometryReader { proxy in
          Color.clear
            .onAppear { 
              height = proxy.size.height 
            }

               height = $0
            }
       }
    }
  }
}
Then you can use your height State property like usual.
⚠️ Beware: You must ensure you will not cause a continuous layout loop here, if your layout responds to height changing in a way that causes the GeometryReader to lay out again and cause height to get updated, you can get into a loop!</p>

There’s an Instruments tool for diagnosing why an update is slow.

<p>When using TCA, a new instance of <code>ObservableObject</code> (the <code>ViewStore</code>) is frequently installed as <code>@ObservedObject</code> when the view tree invalidates.
What are the consequences of vending a new instance (possibly with the same properties' values) in terms of performances?
Would it be absolutely better to reuse the same instance if possible, or is it acceptable as <code>@ObservedObject</code> installation is quite efficient?
Thanks!</p>

<p>It sounds like you have a cycle in your updates. For example, a GeometryReader that writes a preference, that causes the containing view to resize, which causes the GeometryReader to write the preference again.
It’s important to avoid creating such cycles. Often that can be done by moving the GeometryReader higher in the view hierarchy so that it’s size doesn’t change and it can communicate size to it’s subviews instead of using a preference.

<p>To add a little more onto this, even in cases where you will get almost entirely the same behavior between the two, the performance difference will be so minimal that I would strongly suggest prioritizing code readability over performance / memory use to make this decision.

<p>Good question! focusedSceneValue provides a way for the current focused / key window to surface its values to @FocusedValues in menus and other places; this is especially important on macOS since an app can have many windows, but only one of those is key.

<p>Is this an acceptable use of the initializer?

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, this is an acceptable use of the initializer and your understanding is correct: that object will be create only at the beginning of the view lifetime and kept alive. The StateObject ’s wrapped value is an autoclosure that is invoke only once at the beginning of the view lifetime. That also means that SwiftUI will capture the value of plan when is firstly created; something to keep in mind is that if you view identity doesn’t change but you pass a different plan SwiftUI will not notice that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the question! I’m afraid I don’t have a great answer here, but there are a couple of options you can try.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>One option is to use a representable to embed a UITabBarController, so you can hook the delegate methods.</p>
<p>Another option, if you can detect when the user taps the same SwiftUI tab again, is to decorate your NavigationView with .id(counter), where counter is @State private var counter = 0.</p>
<p>Then when the user taps the same SwiftUI tab again, you can increment counter, which changes the identity of the navigation view, causing SwiftUI to replace it.</p>
<p>I’d love to get an enhancement request Feedback for your particular use case so we can prioritize making this easier!</p>

<p>Hi - we currently do not have any API for this, though we’d love if you could file a feedback with any specifics you have for your use case.

<p>Thanks for the question. .environmentObject(…) mostly flows down the view hierarchy, however there are some places where we intentionally do not forward it.

<p>Something like ModifiedContent<MyView, …> with lots of stuff inside the … there.</p>
<p>What I like to do is (1) copy that type, then (2) add a top-level type alias: typealias MyModifiedView = ModifiedContent<MyView, …> where the right-hand side is the value I copied from the error message.</p>

<p>passing a State as a binding through each view in the hierarchy
vs
passing it as an environment object and only access it in the subviews that use it, say in a Text view
would the first one have worse dependency graph that needs more updates?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>environment object is a slightly different tool than State since it requires an ObservableObject. Environment object is optimized to invalidate only the views that read its value.
As for State, when you pass the binding down to subviews, changing the binding will mutate the state that in turn will invalidate the view holding the state and its children.</p>

<p>Lot’s of questions about when it is okay or not to use AnyView!
If you can avoid AnyView, we recommend that. For example, use @ViewBuilder or pass view values around using generics instead of using AnyView.
However, we offer AnyView as API because we understand that there are some situations where no other solution is possible, or comes with other important tradeoffs.
One rule of thumb: AnyView can be okay if used in situations where the wrapped view will rarely or never change. But using AnyView to switch back and forth between different values can cause performance issues, since SwiftUI has to do extra work to manage that.</p>

<p>That error usual means that some code evaluated in body or updateUIViewController  (or NS…) is mutating state.</p>
<p>We have a new debugging tool in the new SDK that might help narrow it down.</p>
<p>Inside body if you write Self._printChanges() SwiftUI will log the name of the property that changed to cause the view to be redrawn.</p>
<p>(Note the underscore. This isn’t API, but is for exposed for debugging.)</p>

<p>It’s great to hear you’re interested in working at Apple! I joined as an intern so I can definitely relate to the craziness of applying, but it is absolutely worth doing. Interning at Apple is a really wonderful experience, and you really do some incredible work over the course of an internship! Getting hired at Apple means being very intentional about what you’re looking for, and the best way to do that is to explore the jobs site for roles you think you can do, and applying specifically for that role. We have thousands of hiring managers and I don’t know most of them, so my recommendation won’t carry much weight, so I can’t be of much help there. My best advice is to create a compelling cover letter and résumé that expresses why you are right for this specific role, rather than applying for dozens of jobs at once.  </p>

For custom presentations, I’ve had good luck putting the presentation content in an overlay, then using an offset modifier to shift it off screen.

As would an offscreen view with opacity of 0.

<p>What’s the best way to structure DetailView and which property wrapper would we use for <code>detailFetcher</code> in DetailView?
1.  Have an initializer like <code>init(itemID: Int)</code>, and use <code>@StateObject</code>? This would require us to eventually update the detailFetcher property with something like <code>detailFetcher.itemID = itemID</code> in the body’s <code>onAppear</code>
2.  Pass in the <code>detailFetcher</code> into the initializer like <code>init(detailFetcher: ObservableObject)</code> and make the property @ObservableObject? If this is preferred, where would this <code>detailFetcher</code> live if not in SwiftUI?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, use @StateObject when the view in question owns the associated object, i.e. the object will be created when the view is created, and should be destroyed when the view is removed.
In contrast, use @ObservedObject when the view needs to reference an object that is owned by another view or something else. So the view is dependent on the object, but their lifetimes are not tied together.
For example, you could have a main screen that uses @StateObject to initialize your app’s model, and then pass that object off to detail screens using @ObservedObject.

<ul>
<li>
<p>Well so this is how it is -
There’s a login screen - it either lets you sign in with apple, sign in with email/password, or create an account. If they pick sign in with apple, and this is the first time they go through the process, then it prompts them with the hide my email/name sheet. Then after that, again if it’s their first time, there’s a screen they go to that asks for their birthday, and it says : Sign in with Apple [apple logo] with a subtitle stating that some additional info is required (paraphrased since it’s a little bit of lengthy text), and then a date picker for their birthday. That Sign in With Apple [apple logo] is sort of replicating what’s on the Sign in with Email screen which similarly says Sign in with Email [envelope icon].</p>

<p>My guess is that it would not be allowed since it is giving users the impression that the birthday is part of the Sign In With Apple process, but that is not the case. I think it’s okay to show the birthday step following the sign in process, but as for showing “Sign In with Apple ” after that, I do not think it is allowed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My recommendation would be to remove this text entirely and instead have something like “Finish setting up your account”
As indeed this does not have anything to do with signing in with Apple</p>

<h4 id="are-navigationlinks-lazy-in-ios-15">Are NavigationLinks "lazy" in iOS 15?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>NavigationLinks do not fully resolve their destinations until they are triggered, though the value of the destination view is created when the NavigationLink is created.
In general, we recommend avoiding as much work as possible when a view is initialized, which would avoid potential issues here. This is important for performance. Instead, have that work be triggered within the view’s body, such as using onAppear or the new task() modifier.
SwiftUI may reinitialize views for any number of reasons, and this is a normal part of the update process.  </p>

<p>Most new features do not back-deploy to earlier OS versions. You can use e.g.
if #available(iOS 15, *) {

That said, some functionality is able to back-deploy. For example, the new ability to pass bindings to collections into List and ForEach, and get back a binding to each element, e.g.
ForEach($elements) { $element in ...
is able to back-deploy to any earlier release supported by SwiftUI.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in a workaround, the Fruta sample code project has an AnimatableFontModifier that uses an explicit font size as its animatable data. This is used for the ingredient cards in the main smoothie detail view. This works for Fruta because the use-case is limited and the text using this modifier is for primarily for graphical purposes.
