    Using ARQL, how might I add a colour picker to change between colours of a model?

    Is there a simple way to create a 3D object with a custom image as a texture? Reality Composer only allows a material and a color, and without that, I'll have to dip into a far more complex 3D app. I'd really, really like to use USDZ more in Motion, for pre-viz and prototyping, but without texture editing it's quite limited.

    Is there a way to capture a snapshot of only the virtual content rendered on-screen, but not the background (having the background be transparent) while continuing the on-screen experience for the user where they still see the virtual content and camera feed?  The use case here is that mixing Vision's person segmentation and ARFaceTrackingConfiguration (trying to overlay 3D content on a tracked face while putting fun backgrounds behind the person in the frame) results in the 3D content typically being cut off due to the segmentation mask.  It'd be great to be able to render the 3D content back on top of the composited segmented image.

    I am working on an app that uses ARKit to guide the user around an object while semi-automatically capturing images for later (server side) 3D reconstruction. I very much appreciate the ability to control the capture session and the ability to capture high resolution images that you added in iOS 16.  I believe currently we do not have much control over the high resolution image capture? It would be great if we could configure the AVCapturePhotoSettings used for the capture.  For photogrammetric reconstruction purposes it would be amazing if we could for example capture a Pro RAW image during the ARKit session.

    I have a strange ARKit+SceneKit rendering bug and wanted to see if any of the engineers ARKit engineers participating here might have an idea as to what might be causing this and how to fix it? I am rendering a semi-transparent object using SceneKit. The material uses the constant lighting model, a texture controls transparency.  If the scene is fairly bright, then the transparent material will initially show less transparent than it should. If the camera gets pointed at something less bright (or the bright part is blocked as in the example video linked below) then the rendering suddenly switches to be more transparent. This switch is permanent, it does not switch back again.  See example video here:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/8wpo83loxg51o43/ARKit_rendering_bug.mov?dl=0|https://www.dropbox.com/s/8wpo83loxg51o43/ARKit_rendering_bug.mov?dl=0 Any idea what might be causing this?

    Video feed is always overexposed using ARKit. Trying to enable HDR for ARSession doesn't seem to work. Setting videoHDRAllowed to true on ARWorldTrackingConfiguration does not change video rendering. Also when accessing the AVCaptureDevice with ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.configurableCaptureDeviceForPrimaryCamera, activeFormat.isVideoHDRSupported returns false (on iPhone 12 Pro Max) so I cannot set captureDevice.isVideoHDREnabled to true. Also when using setExposureModeCustom and setting iso to activeFormat.minISO, the image rendered by ARKit has always a way greater exposure than when running an AVCaptureSession. The use case is for using ARKit in a Basketball stadium: the pitch always appears totally white with ARKit so we cannot see any player while with AVCaptureSession (or just the iOS camera app) the pitch and players appear clearly thanks to HDR.

    Hi! We're working on an AR experience that allows user to put AR objects in their surroundings and replay it later. We're saving the data on an ARWorldMap and archive it on the filesystem to be retrieved later. Everything works great on smaller areas with small ARWorldMap file sizes. However as user adds more stuff, the ARWorldMap file gets bigger and at some point, it takes so long or even impossible to relocalize using the big ARWorldMap files. I'm seeing slower relocalization on ARWorldMap files with 10 mb size.   Question: Is there like a known cap of how big ARWorldMap files can be to retain effectivenes of relocalization and the AR experience?  What can impact performance for AR relocalization other than lighting condition and the object textures that we're rendering (maybe area size? camera motion? features in the area?) since we're seeing frame drops on bigger ARWorldMap files.  Thanks!

    It seems a bit weird that there's currently three different implementations of USD at use across iOS / Mac. Are there plans to consolidate those into one to make testing and verification of assets across platforms easier?  The shared feature subset is pretty small, resulting in less-than-ideal products for clients.

    I am working on an app that uses ARKit to guide the user around an object while semi-automatically capturing images for later (server side) 3D reconstruction. I very much appreciate the ability to control the capture session and the ability to capture high resolution images that you added in iOS 16.  I believe currently we do not have much control over the high resolution image capture? It would be great if we could configure the AVCapturePhotoSettings used for the capture.  For photogrammetric reconstruction purposes it would be amazing if we could for example capture a Pro RAW image during the ARKit session.

    I have a strange ARKit+SceneKit rendering bug and wanted to see if any of the engineers ARKit engineers participating here might have an idea as to what might be causing this and how to fix it? I am rendering a semi-transparent object using SceneKit. The material uses the constant lighting model, a texture controls transparency.  If the scene is fairly bright, then the transparent material will initially show less transparent than it should. If the camera gets pointed at something less bright (or the bright part is blocked as in the example video linked below) then the rendering suddenly switches to be more transparent. This switch is permanent, it does not switch back again.  See example video here:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/8wpo83loxg51o43/ARKit_rendering_bug.mov?dl=0|https://www.dropbox.com/s/8wpo83loxg51o43/ARKit_rendering_bug.mov?dl=0 Any idea what might be causing this?

    Video feed is always overexposed using ARKit. Trying to enable HDR for ARSession doesn't seem to work. Setting videoHDRAllowed to true on ARWorldTrackingConfiguration does not change video rendering. Also when accessing the AVCaptureDevice with ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.configurableCaptureDeviceForPrimaryCamera, activeFormat.isVideoHDRSupported returns false (on iPhone 12 Pro Max) so I cannot set captureDevice.isVideoHDREnabled to true. Also when using setExposureModeCustom and setting iso to activeFormat.minISO, the image rendered by ARKit has always a way greater exposure than when running an AVCaptureSession. The use case is for using ARKit in a Basketball stadium: the pitch always appears totally white with ARKit so we cannot see any player while with AVCaptureSession (or just the iOS camera app) the pitch and players appear clearly thanks to HDR.

    Hi! We're working on an AR experience that allows user to put AR objects in their surroundings and replay it later. We're saving the data on an ARWorldMap and archive it on the filesystem to be retrieved later. Everything works great on smaller areas with small ARWorldMap file sizes. However as user adds more stuff, the ARWorldMap file gets bigger and at some point, it takes so long or even impossible to relocalize using the big ARWorldMap files. I'm seeing slower relocalization on ARWorldMap files with 10 mb size.   Question: Is there like a known cap of how big ARWorldMap files can be to retain effectivenes of relocalization and the AR experience?  What can impact performance for AR relocalization other than lighting condition and the object textures that we're rendering (maybe area size? camera motion? features in the area?) since we're seeing frame drops on bigger ARWorldMap files.  Thanks!

<p>|U03HHPAD0MQ|:
&lt;@U03J2DUEV0X&gt; I don’t see any updates on this one unfortunately :disappointed:</p>
<p>|U03J2DUEV0X|:
I reported, what I consider a critical RK bug over 4 months ago, no resolution. Forum ref title: iOS 15 RealityKit AnchorEntity possible bug</p>
<p>|U03J2DUEV0X|:
and I have several more...unfortunately all stuck with no resolution.</p>
<p>|U03HHPAD0MQ|:
FB9679173 should be resolved in iOS 16 beta 1</p>
<p>|U03J2DUEV0X|:
can you not filter out my lounge request about why RC has not advanced in almost 2 years? stuck at version 1.5 as of xcode 14 Beta. I'm building a product with your framework, so this is a healthy conversation.</p>
<p>|U03HHPAD0MQ|:
let me see, but we don’t really have much to share regarding RC. We’re aware that it hasn’t been updated in a while could benefit from more features, but don’t have anything to announce right now. but we can start another thread about it</p>
<p>|U03J2DUEV0X|:

<p>|U03K75823EU|:
Not the expert here, I believe that a “Location Anchor” is what you are interested in. I don’t know how you would set one up without getting into coding though. I believe one of the videos from WWDC last year addressed this?</p>
<p>|U03HERKQDJ9|:
Multiuser AR experiences can be created using the <code>SynchronizationComponent</code>, found here: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/synchronizationcomponent">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/synchronizationcomponent</a>
This is a good tutorial (along with sample code) on building collaborative AR sessions between devices: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/creating_a_collaborative_session">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/creating_a_collaborative_session</a></p>
<p>|U03J4E0D87N|:
Also not an expert here, but I'm looking into that also. If you're comfortable with Unity, Niantic (Pokemon Go)  just released a platform and some demo projects to do multi user AR. It's called Lightship.</p>
<p>|U03K75823EU|:
&lt;@U03JRQ5LY2C&gt;, here’s the session from last year that I mentioned. It might help to get you started… <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10611/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10611/</a></p>
<p>|U03JRQ5LY2C|:
Are there any examples using SwiftUI? All of the code seems to be using Storyboards, though I assume they can easily be transferred over into a SwiftUI view using either a UIViewControllerRepresentable; or generally converting the general lifecycle of a multiuser AR app to fit SwiftUI standards.</p>
<p>|U03HERKQDJ9|:
The view that contains the <code>ARView</code> will still need to be a UIKit view but that can easily be bridged to other SwiftUI views using a <code>UIViewRepresentable</code>: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable</a>
Most of the AR collaboration code in the sample here is just Swift code that can easily be abstracted out and used in your app: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/creating_a_collaborative_session">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/creating_a_collaborative_session</a></p>

Thank you, &lt;@U03HHPAHQ3C&gt;.  Was this also the case prior to iOS 15.4?  I recall the Capture Sample project from WWDC 2021 already leveraged depth data, but not sure if that depth data was already using LiDAR?</p>
<p>|U03J7GGBZDW|:
Hi Brandon, yes we already supported depth in last years version of object capture. It does not have to come from LiDAR. There are different ways to capture depth on Apple devices.

<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
Hey there, thanks for your question.</p>
<p>Generally Systems are designed to operate on Entities (within Scenes) and their Components. Each System can be updated against multiple Scenes (and the Scene’s entities).</p>
<p>If you have state that you want to be represented with a System, one method to do that is to have a root entity that holds a “System component”.</p>
<p>There’s more information on System’s in last years WWDC session and on the developer documentation website:</p>

Unfortunately, we don’t discuss our future plans. However, we are aware that our tools haven’t been updated in a few years and could use some new features. Could you share what features you are looking for us to add?</p>
<p>|U03J2DUEV0X|:
FA id: FB9570859</p>
<p>|U03J4E0D87N|:
It would be awesome to see features that are announced in Reality Kit be compatible with Reality Composer. Like videos, video textures, post processing effects.</p>
<p>|U03J4E0D87N|:
Love RC and can't wait to see it updated.</p>
<p>|U03J2DUEV0X|:
Cannot apply properties to group object
Cannot multi-select behaviors to delete
Cannot copy multi-selected behaviors
Need an object navigator to select scene objects to modify
Need Opacity/Texture/Materials for objects/groups</p>
<p>|U03JELU9E5P|:
I would love to see Meshes or Objects that have Emissive lighting.  Or in other words objects that would glow and be emissive similar to what we see in Unity and Unreal.</p>
<p>|U03J2DUEV0X|:
I could keep going with features, but need to be mindful that RC is not in the league of Maya, for example.</p>
<p>|U03J2DUEV0X|:
also Animation timeline, minimal</p>
<p>|U03J4E0D87N|:
Oh yeah, object navigator and animation timeline would be incredible.</p>
<p>|U03JELU9E5P|:
I would also love to see a visual or graphical shader editor similar to Shader Graph from Unity.   It does not have to be really complex, even a basic visual editor for RealityKit / Reality Composer shaders would be awesome!</p>
<p>|U03J97X79CL|:
&lt;@U03JELU9E5P&gt; use emissive texture with black as diffuseColor to achive this. It would glow (no overwhites) but can change the look a lot</p>
<p>|U03HMCNEGVD|:
I’d really, really like to see material importing and placement options, so that we can at least apply a simple texture to a simple object in Reality Composer, rather than having to dive into a more complex 3D app. Right now, we can only change the color and the material type. (Unless I’ve missed something?</p>

Yes, please ask this during the object capture lounge tomorrow. But you should be able to modify after export and re-render</p>

I had this same sort of question. From my look at the docs, you could possibly create a RealityKit Entity using the RoomCaptureData.</p>
<p>For removing elements, it looks like you should be able to remove array elements within RoomCaptureData and then write that to usdz</p>

Yes, all those things should technically be possible. You would need to use the <code>RoomCaptureSession</code> API and subscribe to a delegate to get those updates which contain the Surfaces and Objects. You can then process that data and render it as per your liking</p>

Hi! Can you explain a little bit more what you’re trying to do?</p>
<p>If you have a use-case in mind for a new feature you’re definitely also welcome to file a Feedback item with us via <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/">https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/</a></p>
<p>|U03J88TDVC6|:
will reality kit work with swift ui views ? &lt;@U03H3628BL7&gt;</p>
<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
You can host RealityKit content inside SwiftUI views with UIViewRepresentable (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable</a>)</p>
<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
If you’re asking if you can use SwiftUI content within RealityKit - there is no direct support for that at present and we’d ask you to file a feedback item explaining your use-case for that feature.</p>
<p>|U03J2DUEV0X|:
I want to inject SwiftUI charts, for example into my RK scene with live updates via Observables. this will be very useful when there is a need for being surrounded in AR space with analytics about equipment telemetry, etc.</p>
<p>|U03J88TDVC6|:
thanks</p>
<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
Oh that’s a great idea. Please do file a feedback item.</p>
<p>|U03J2DUEV0X|:
we filed a FA for this feature quite some time ago. no reply, will look it up.</p>

Thanks for the suggestion! You may want to check with the SF Symbols team to confirm this is not possible yet, and also file a feature request on feedback assistant.</p>

&lt;@U03J7GC4DEC&gt;  had a fb open for almost a year now :grin:
SF Symbols in MeshResource.generateText() - FB7959655</p>
<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
A bit of a hack solution but you may be able to get this work via drawing the Symbol to a CGImage and passing that image in as a texture.</p>
<p>|U03J21GJSG2|:
that would work for a 2d solution, but ideally it would be a prism</p>
<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
Ah yeah. Alright thanks for the FB item in that case.</p>
<p>|U03J21GJSG2|:
it sounds like the reason it doesn't automatically work does come down to the sf symbols team… is there a way i could get this ticket to that team? no lounge etc</p>
<p>|U03HHPAD0MQ|:
it looks like the bug is actually in RealityKit, so it’s on the proper team right now. We’ll discuss this bug internally with the team.</p>

<p>|U03JA5TGENQ|:
&lt;@U03HL4ZB05S&gt; Definitely!
1. Seeing that USDZ and glTF are both planned to be supported, I'm of course curious about scene graph access. This kind of clashes with the notion that "rendered model data ... is not exposed by the page"
2. Given that our typical usecase is AR, I really wonder how the &lt;model&gt; tag would interact with AR in general and QuickLook in particular. This goes into areas of immersive sessions, dom-overlays, etc. - e.g. when I have styled audio control buttons in HTML, I definitely would want to have those in AR as well.</p>

There are different USD renderers across our platforms but each serve a different purpose.

Does Storm work on iOS?</p>
<p>|U03JA5TGENQ|:
I'm (painfully!) aware of these differences, that's why I'm asking :slightly_smiling_face: Currently, testing a single USDZ model to actually work in AR across different iOS versions is really hard. Having a somewhat more unified USD renderer (or at least a way to use the same one from Mac or a browser than what's used on QuickLook) would definitely accelerate client adoption of USDZ.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HERS88UD|:
Hi &lt;@U03HMDX5C95&gt;, yes this is something that is supported in AR Quick Look. You can place objects on the ceiling by dragging them there. This can be done using a regular horizontal (or vertical) anchor.
However, there are potential challenges to be aware, the biggest is that ceilings usually lack a lot of feature points, which makes it difficult to detect a proper plane. Using a device with lidar can improve the results that you get.</p>
<p>|U03HMDX5C95|:
Thanks for your reply. I was more wondering about placing this file on the ceiling to begin with, rather than making the user drag the model there themselves. Is this possible?</p>
<p>|U03HERS88UD|:
Can you describe in more detail how you would want this to work? Eg. after the asset gets loaded, what would the user need to do to see the asset on the ceiling?</p>
<p>|U03HMDX5C95|:
For example ARQL could guide them to point their device to the ceiling to view the model? It's just that for pendant lights, they come from the ceiling, so having them attached to the wall isn't super useful to people and doesn't provide a great experience currently.</p>
<p>|U03HERS88UD|:
One way to let users know that they can move objects to the ceiling is to include a 3D banner with additional instructions.</p>
<p>|U03HMDX5C95|:
Sure, but that experience is less than ideal I think. It would be great having these land directly on the ceiling. Is it worth me filing feedback?</p>

<p>|U03J7GPCT8Q|:
You could use Reality Composer's interactions to make an interactive USD where you can tap on different colors to change the model</p>
<p>|U03HMDX5C95|:
Thanks for your reply. Do you have any examples? It's my understanding that I wouldn't be able to do this as a 2D UI/Card above the ARQL experience, but rather would have to have it as part of the 3D AR experience? If that makes sense?</p>
<p>|U03HERS88UD|:
Yes this needs to be done in 3D. There’s a previous <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/609/">session</a> that has some examples</p>
<p>|U03HMDX5C95|:
Thanks for clarifying. It would be really useful if we could provide a 2D/Card UI over the ARQL experience to do this (and it would be great for Apple to be able to show different colours of devices without jumping in and out of ARQL, too). We can already embed html in ARQL, if this could link to different scenes in a .reality file it would be amazing and make the experience so much better for users. I would file feedback for this but feel as if my other feedback requests have gone unnoticed – is there a better way to get ideas noticed? Does a prototype of what we are looking for help?</p>

<p>|U03J7GN26C8|:
Hello Matthew!
This is not currently possible to do in a USD, but you should submit the idea to <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com">https://feedbackassistant.apple.com</a>.
You can however do some particle effects in an app by using RealityKit's CustomShaders.</p>
<p>|U03JA5TGENQ|:
Depending on how complex your effect is, you can also bake your particle effects to regular mesh + bones animation :sparkles:</p>
<p>|U03JA5TGENQ|:
In many cases you can also create a pretty convincing effect just by scaling/rotating a few planes. <a href="https://prefrontalcortex.de/labs/model-viewer/upload/kravity/|Example link">https://prefrontalcortex.de/labs/model-viewer/upload/kravity/|Example link</a> (no USDZ behind that right now, but you get the idea - this is just two simple meshes for the particles)</p>

Have I missed something? :)</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HL4ZB05S|:
Thanks Iain. Can you explain what kind of 3D object you want to create with a textures? A complex object or a simple plane?</p>
<p>|U03HMCNEGVD|:
A relatively simple object. For a recent project I needed to create playing pieces similar to dominos, but each one with a different, complex image on it. I was able to use Motion’s 3D text support to extrude a rounded rectangle, but I’d prefer to do this with USDZ as it’s far more widely supported.</p>
<p>|U03HMCNEGVD|:
Motion’s 3D text support is exactly the kind of texture placement and scaling support I’m looking for, by the way.</p>
<p>|U03HL4ZB05S|:
There are various third-party DCCs with great USD support that let you create complex 3D object with textures and export as USD. You can then use RealityConverter to convert those to USDZ to import into Motion.</p>
<p>|U03HMCNEGVD|:
Understood — though they’re a huge jump up in complexity and it would be great to see this built into RC. Do you have any specific recommendations for a third-party app that’s easy to use for simple objects?</p>
<p>|U03JA5TGENQ|:
Another approach: three.js (web render engine) can actually create USDZs on the fly from 3D scenes. A colleague used that recently for USDZ AR files with changeable textures on <a href="https://webweb.jetzt/ar-gallery/ar-gallery.html">https://webweb.jetzt/ar-gallery/ar-gallery.html</a></p>
<p>|U03JA5TGENQ|:
(users have to leave AR to change the textures but then can even load custom images into it)</p>
<p>|U03HMCNEGVD|:
OK, will look into three.js as a potential solution. Please consider adding texture support into RC though — it would be a great way to create simple objects and make simple edits to existing objects.</p>
<p>|U03HMCNEGVD|:
Thank you!</p>
<p>|U03JA5TGENQ|:
Ah, I think I understood the question a bit differently - I think you're referring to "drag in a generic model and then change the texture in RC" - three.js is most certainly overkill for that :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03HMCNEGVD|:
Yes, that’s pretty much it. For example, it would be great to be able to create a simple rectangular plane, then put a custom image on the front face. Simple stuff, and most 3D apps are far, far more complex. Blender in particular is a UI nightmare.</p>
<p>|U03HL4ZB05S|:
Also take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10141|Explore USD tools and rendering">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10141|Explore USD tools and rendering</a> session tomorrow. You can now change materials properties in RealityConverter!</p>
<p>|U03HMCNEGVD|:
Great! That’s going to be a huge help — good to know.</p>
<p>|U03JA5TGENQ|:
Another thing that might help for making quick adjustments: the browser-based three.js editor at <a href="https://threejs.org/editor">https://threejs.org/editor</a>.
Here's how to make a plane with a custom image and export that as USDZ:</p>
<p>|U03HMCNEGVD|:
Just checking — can I import USDZ into Reality Converter, just to change the texture, or should I use some intermediate format?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HB56DJTG|:
Yes, if you can export your assets to FBX, glTF or OBJ, you can convert them to USDZ using Reality Converter, which is compatible with ARKit and RealityKit</p>
<p>|U03K75823EU|:
We’ve run into problems with materials and textures when exporting them in various formats to USDZ. It seems that the pipeline from some 3d modeling applications (our use is primarily for product and transportation design) - Maya, Rhino 3d, Solidworks, isn’t really smooth. Exporting files to Keyshot to assign textures seems to help in some cases. In many though the materials and textures don’t really work to our satisfaction. Perhaps newer versions of Reality Converter will be more successful?</p>

<p>You can assemble different USDZ assets together to build out a larger scene in Reality Composer and add triggers and actions to individual assets within the project</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7GN26C8|:
Yes, if you load the USDZ with "Entity.load(...)" or "Entity.loadAsync(...)" you can traverse the hierarchy and modify the individual entities.</p>
<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
You’d want to use <code>Entity.isEnabled</code>  in this instance to hide/show a node.</p>
<p>|U03HHPAHQ3C|:
Note that .<code>loadModel</code> will flatten the hierarchy whereas <code>.load</code> will show all entities</p>
<p>|U03KF984WHW|:
Ah, so each child-node is then an entity?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHPAHQ3C|:
You can use the <code>installGestures</code> function on <code>ARView.</code> Keep in mind that the entity will need to conform to <code>HasCollision</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/arview/installgestures(_:for:)">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/arview/installgestures(_:for:)</a></p>
<p>|U03J20E7UBV|:
Thank you, &lt;@U03HHPAHQ3C&gt;!  Can I follow-up and ask if there is any documentation on how to make an <code>Entity</code> loaded from <code>Entity.loadAsync(...)</code> conform to <code>HasCollision</code> so I can use <code>installGestures(_:for:)</code>, as this is where I seem to be struggling to understand.</p>
<p>|U03HHPAHQ3C|:
You could create your own CollisionComponent with custom mesh and add it to your entity or you could simply call <code>generateCollisionShapes(recursive: Bool)</code> on your entity.
 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/entity/generatecollisionshapes(recursive:)">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/entity/generatecollisionshapes(recursive:)</a></p>
<p>|U03J20E7UBV|:
Thank you, &lt;@U03HHPAHQ3C&gt;!  Just for posterity, I can call <code>generateCollisionShapes(recursive: Bool)</code> on my Entity before adding it as a child to the anchor, and call <code>installGestures</code> on <code>ARView</code> before adding the entity as a child to the anchor, and that should give me interactivity on the Entity itself?</p>
<p>|U03HHPAHQ3C|:
You can use <code>.loadModel/.loadModelAsync</code>, which will flatten the USDZ into a single entity. Then call <code>generateCollisionShapes</code> and pass that entity to the <code>installGestures</code> function. This will make your USDZ one single entity that you can interact with.</p>
<p>|U03J20E7UBV|:
Got it!  Thank you so much for the follow-up, &lt;@U03HHPAHQ3C&gt;.  This has been super helpful!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HERKMSER|:
We don’t have any materials you can apply to objects to make them participate in the same shadows as ground planes, however, you can enable shadow casting from directional and spot lights via <code>DirectionalLightComponent.Shadows</code> and <code>SpotLightComponent.Shadows</code>. This may alter the overall lighting of your scene though.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we do have <code>CustomMaterial</code>, which allows you to &lt;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/modifying-realitykit-rendering-using-custom-materials

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
That’s a good question.</p>
<p>I think you can get some of the way there via the ARKit apis to get the current frame.</p>
<p>You can also toggle the mode of an ARView to switch it to .nonAR view - then use ARView.snapshot() to grab a snapshot of the virtual content. And then switch it back.</p>
<p>However I don’t <em>believe</em> that would give you exactly what you want - I think the ARView snapshot would not necessarily have a transparent background (if that’s what you need).</p>
<p>And even then the performance of this may not be great.</p>
<p>I’d suggest filing a feature request for this with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/">https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/</a></p>
<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
I think a feedback item and an explanation of your use cases would be very welcome.</p>
<p>|U03J21GJSG2|:
instead of changing the mode to nonAR, you could replace the camera feed with a solid colour (green), then take the snapshot</p>
<p>|U03JLNNFUSD|:
But I don‘t think the user will be happy with this green background in the time of the snapshot</p>
<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
You certainly could try setting the Environment background color to something with 100% alpha</p>
<p>|U03H3628BL7|:
And if it doesn’t work a bug report with just that would certainly be useful.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HERKQDJ9|:
One of our designers answered your question:
&gt; It depends which approach is best — each have a set of pros and cons based on what you want out of the experience. It can be compelling to run through AR blocks if you want to emphasize lots of user motion in an experience and the scale of the experience is quite large — good for apps that can take advantage of wide open spaces. Tapping them is more immediate and indirect so if you wanted to destroy a tower quickly or something like that then that would be the way to go — and I could see that being very satisfying to trigger many physics objects to react at once. I think the same would apply to a button press, it’s an indirect way to trigger it if the experience requires rapidly knocking them down.
&gt; 
&gt; Overall I think it’s up to what you want the experience to be, and maintaining internal consistency with other interactions within the app.</p>
<p>|U03HERKQDJ9|:
Swiftstrike and Swiftshot are great example apps that use similar techniques:

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHPAHQ3C|:
Is this an rcproj that is embedded in an Xcode project? Sounds like you might be able to grab the position of the entity with the force applied to it and then set the new scene’s position as that position?</p>
<p>|U03JGBHR8BV|:
Started with a USDZ, and then added behaviors to it in Reality Composer.  No Xcode involved.</p>
<p>|U03JGBHR8BV|:
Perhaps there’s a way to get the post force position in Reality Composer?  I have to play the animation to finality, but then there is no way to observe the objects new XYZ coordinates, unless I stop the animation (but thus returning the object to its origin).  I suppose a strong feature would be a way to view the object’s live parameters during animation mode.</p>
<p>|U03HHPAHQ3C|:
This may be achievable if embedded in Xcode with some code. I recommend signing up for a Reality Composer lab if you would like to explore that further.

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HERKMSER|:
A way to get the entity gestures working on an entire scene is to use <code>visualBounds(…)</code> and create a <code>CollisionComponent</code> on the root entity. You can then use &lt;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/controlling_entity_collisions_in_realitykit
|CollisionGroup&gt; to make sure it doesn’t interfere with any physics.</p>
<p>If you’re using <code>ARView.installGestures(…)</code> you’ll need the entity to conform to <code>HasCollision</code> , which may require you to create a new entity type for the root. Quick example:</p>
<pre><code>// New Entity type which conforms for `HasCollision`
class CollisionAnchorEntity: Entity, HasAnchoring, HasCollision { }

// Transfer scene contents
let collisionAnchor = CollisionAnchorEntity()
collisionAnchor.children.append(contentsOf: originalAnchor.children)
collisionAnchor.anchoring = originalAnchor.anchoring

// Create CollisionComponent for bounds of scene
let sceneBounds = collisionAnchor.visualBounds(recursive: true, relativeTo: collisionAnchor)
let collisionShape = ShapeResource.generateBox(size: sceneBounds.extents)
    .offsetBy(translation: sceneBounds.center)
collisionAnchor.collision = CollisionComponent(shapes: [collisionShape])

// Install gesture on new anchor
arView.installGestures(for: collisionAnchor)
</code></pre>

<p>|U03J7GBRZ5W|:
Using data scanner via VisionKit is possible using ARKit. ARKit provides the captured image on the <code>ARFrame</code>. One can inject the ARFrame's captured image into data scanner and obtain information about text.</p>
<p>However, the result will be two-dimensional. If the use-case is to bring the detected text into the AR world in three dimensions one needs to estimate a transform for the 2D text. ARKit does not support this natively but does support custom anchoring.</p>

I believe currently we do not have much control over the high resolution image capture? It would be great if we could configure the AVCapturePhotoSettings used for the capture.

Hi Stephen,
The depth map surfaced through the Scene Depth API does align with the wide angle camera and should correspond to the camera transform available through the ARFrame.</p>
<p>Here is a sample code that generates a colored point cloud by combining the wide angle camera image and depth map</p>

<p>|U03H35XE3N3|:
Hey Ramiro! Regardless of your educational background, anyone can learn how to code if you put in the effort and are passionate about it. There are tons of resources online, many of which have been produced by Apple in the form of documentation, example projects, and WWDC videos, that can help you to learn a programming language, such as Swift. I would suggest doing some tutorials, watching videos, maybe find a highly rated book on iOS programming, etc to learn how to begin building iOS apps. Once you are comfortable with that, then you can start to dive into AR specifically. Finding a good book on linear algebra would be useful if you are going to get into AR and graphics programming, but start with the basics first!</p>
<p>For <code>ARKit</code>, we have all sorts of documentation and examples that you can take a look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/</a></p>

<p>You may find the camera's captured images on the <code>ARFrame</code> and can inject this into Vision. So by combining multiple frameworks you could achieve something close to the requested feature.</p>

For long distance occlusion and collision purposes?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7GC2A2C|:
There is no integration of MapKit into the ARView. If you know the building footprint (i.e. the polygon in lat/lon coordinates) or even exact geometry anchored to a lat/lon coordinate you can transform these coordinates by placing a GeoAnchor at a that location and work with the local coordinates for the purposes of occlusion and collision.</p>
<p>|U03J22UJ3T4|:
I wanted to occlude something big like buildings in front of a dinosaur terrorizing downtown</p>
<p>|U03J22UJ3T4|:
I think this might work, when the players keep their vision down.</p>
<p>|U03J7GC2A2C|:
So what I meant is if you know the four corners of that building you can create four Location Anchors at those lat/lon coordinates. If they are tracked in ARKit you get the local coordinates and can build an occlusion/collision mesh.</p>
<p>|U03J22UJ3T4|:
Wow, thank you for the help. I didn't think about pushing it that far with geoanchors </p>

We are not exposing the heading directly. You can create any GeoAnchor in your vicinity and then compare its transform with your camera’s transform.

Somehow a switch seems to be flipped that changes SceneKit’s rendering dramatically. But based on my understanding I would think it has to be ARKit that is flipping that switch (intentionally or accidentally) based on the scene brightness.</p>
<p>|U03JRPTG8BS|:
Where by ‘scene’ I am referring to the real world surrounding..</p>
<p>|U03HWCBGUBT|:
You can try setting <code>automaticallyUpdatesLighting</code>to <code>false</code> in <code>ARSCNView</code> to disable the behavior.</p>

Hi Brandon,</p>
<p>To capture and replay an ARKit session, see an example here:
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession/recording_and_replaying_ar_session_data">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession/recording_and_replaying_ar_session_data</a></p>
<p>If you want to capture video in your app in order to do post processing later, you could use and configure an AVAssetWriter to capture a video.
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetwriter">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetwriter</a></p>
<p>|U03J20E7UBV|:
Thanks, &lt;@U03K4D9U7GU&gt;!  Just to follow-up on that comment; do you have a suggest way of getting the output of the ARSession into a format that can be written to an AVAssetWriter (I'm imagining this would require a custom Metal processing pipeline to convert the MTLTextures to CVPixelBuffers, as I don't think there's a way of getting CVPixelBuffers out of ARKit directly)?</p>
<p>|U03K4D9U7GU|:
We do provide a camera frame with every ARFrame, see: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe/2867984-capturedimage">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe/2867984-capturedimage</a></p>
<p>|U03J20E7UBV|:
Thanks, &lt;@U03K4D9U7GU&gt;!  Just for posterity; the ARFrame's CVPixelBuffer (rather, <code>capturedImage</code> property) doesn't include the overlaid AR content, as the user might see through the phone, though, correct?  This is the background video feed only?</p>
<p>|U03J7GC2A2C|:
Yes, ARFrame’s <code>capturedImage</code> is just the ‘clean slate’, it doesn’t contain any virtual content rendered on top of it.</p>
<p>|U03H35XE3N3|:
Yeah, the output from <code>ARKit</code> is just the camera frame without virtual content. If you are doing your own rendering and your metal textures are backed by <code>IOSurface</code> s. then you can easily create <code>CVPixelBuffer</code> s using the <code>IOSurface</code> s and then pass those to <code>AVFoundation</code> for recording.</p>
<p>|U03J20E7UBV|:
Got it, thanks, &lt;@U03J7GC2A2C&gt; &lt;@U03H35XE3N3&gt;.  I thought that was the case!  I appreciate your replies!</p>

Hi Gaetan,</p>
<p>We recommend adding ARAnchors and associating your virtual content with ARAnchors. In case there is a drift, the anchor delegate <code>didUpdateAnchor</code> would update the anchor such that the virtual content stays in the same location in the real world.</p>

<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
Many of them work together...are there particular corner cases you had?</p>
<p>|U03K4D9U7GU|:
Hi Oliver,</p>
<p>We understand that the number of frameworks can be daunting sometimes. However as you alluded to, we try and offer "high level" frameworks to try and meet developers' needs out of the box, for example, being able to use RealityKit for rendering instead of the lower level Metal.</p>
<p>That said, Apple provides several tutorials and code samples to introduce developers into the various frameworks, e.g. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/building_an_immersive_experience_with_realitykit">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/building_an_immersive_experience_with_realitykit</a>.</p>
<p>Another great resource are WWDC videos, which go back several years in order to build a solid understanding of a particular framework or technology.
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/all-videos/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/all-videos/</a></p>
<p>For ARKit specific, see Ryan's great answer here:

<p>|U03JRNE4KJL|:
&lt;@U03K4D9U7GU&gt; thank you, these are fine vertical guides but I’m looking for a more horizontal approach.</p>
<p>|U03JRNE4KJL|:
(super specific example, probably needing, camera, vision, realitykit, arkit…):
can we let the user take a picture of a tree and map it as a texture easily onto a pair of glasses frame for AR preview when he is looking into the mirror?</p>
<p>|U03JRNE4KJL|:
the solution would probably need a USDZ frame model to be rendered in RealityKit, but can we map a UIImage onto an element in USDZ programatically?</p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
I'm pretty sure RealityKit has <code>TextureResource</code> which can take a <code>CGImage</code> (the base decoding class) and goes "up" to a <code>MetalTexture</code></p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
Knowing the basic data flow helps here because taking a photo means a photo file which has to be decoded first into some kind of pixel buffer</p>
<p>|U03HZ4PT2ER|:
Then that has to go to the GPU, usually as a texture</p>

<p>|U03J7GBRZ5W|:
Body tracking runs at 60 Hz at the same cadence of the camera. We cannot compute this faster than this. However, by changing the <code>ARVideoFormat</code> you may change this to <code>30 Hz</code> or other supported frame rates.</p>
<p>We do not offer a functionality to write the motion capture data to file. However, our data is very well compatible with a format called BVH. By following the topology of the skeleton given by the <code>ARSkeletonDefinition</code> and the data coming from an <code>ARBodyAnchor</code>one could generate such a file output.</p>

After getting a geometry that is good enough you still have to solve the task of isolating your object of choice and computing its volume. There would be several ways of doing it. For example cutting everything off above the ground level, or letting the user create a cube objects and then intersect it with the scene geometry, we do not have any code sample for these tasks, though.</p>

Trying to enable HDR for ARSession doesn't seem to work. Setting videoHDRAllowed to true on ARWorldTrackingConfiguration does not change video rendering. Also when accessing the AVCaptureDevice with ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.configurableCaptureDeviceForPrimaryCamera, activeFormat.isVideoHDRSupported returns false (on iPhone 12 Pro Max) so I cannot set captureDevice.isVideoHDREnabled to true. Also when using setExposureModeCustom and setting iso to activeFormat.minISO, the image rendered by ARKit has always a way greater exposure than when running an AVCaptureSession. The use case is for using ARKit in a Basketball stadium: the pitch always appears totally white with ARKit so we cannot see any player while with AVCaptureSession (or just the iOS camera app) the pitch and players appear clearly thanks to HDR.</h4>

<p>|U03HWCCTAKT|:
Hi Brian! Setting <code>videoHDRAllowed</code> means that HDR will be enabled on the formats supporting it; however this is not the case for all video formats.
In iOS 16, <code>ARVideoFormat</code> has a new property <code>isVideoHDRSupported</code>. You can filter the list of the configuration’s <code>supportedVideoFormats</code> to find one where <code>videoHDRSupported</code> is <code>true</code>, and set this format as the configuration’s <code>videoFormat</code> before running the session.</p>

I just tried it, and it worked! Thanks :smile: This is a great addition to ARKit!
A big thank you to the ARKit team for giving us access to those video options!</p>

<p>|U03HWCCTAKT|:
Hi Alexandre, ARKit doesn’t support physics but rather detects the surrounding scene to allow RealityKit to handle virtual objects. RealityKit does support rigid body physics and a good place to start looking is at the physics APIs here: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/usdz_schemas_for_ar/simulated_physical_interaction/preliminary_physicsrigidbodyapi">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/usdz_schemas_for_ar/simulated_physical_interaction/preliminary_physicsrigidbodyapi</a></p>

<p>|U03HWCCTAKT|:
Hi Ioannis, we have a limited pool of resources for our ARFrames and in order to keep some available for ARKit to process, we recommend processing the frames as quickly as possible. If you need to perform longer computations, you can copy an ARFrame and release the ARFrame from the delegate method.</p>

Glad you’re also a fan of the new desk view feature. There are potentially two solutions to this: You might just try to to a single perspective projections for the whole image The second solution is to use a per-pixel correction like you suggested. Both come with their own benefits and drawbacks. Please check out our documentation for implementing the second approach:

Hi Brian! ARKit has no built-in hand or finger detection, but you can use Vision to track hands or detect hand poses.

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7GC2A2C|:
Hey Abraham, throwing machine learning at it sounds like a super fun project, I would recommend to start a bit simpler. So as a small experiment you can take the four corners of a building from the Maps app and then create four Location Anchors based on these coordinates. As soon as those are tracked you can look at the local coordinates (in x,y,z) and then build a polygon based on it, you can extrude it towards the sky (y up) to get a nice collision/occlusion mesh.</p>
<p>|U03J22UJ3T4|:
I will try Christian. I will have the code publicly hosted on GitHub<a href="https://github.com/Ansel7/Mobius">https://github.com/Ansel7/Mobius</a>) and probably create some kind of tutorial on this journey.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HWCCTAKT|:
Hi Dan! ARKit allows streaming video from only one camera at a time. Which camera is used is determined by your configuration (e.g. <code>ARFaceTrackingConfiguration</code> will use the front facing camera, <code>ARWorldTrackingConfiguration</code> will use the back wide camera).</p>
<p>You can, however, enable face anchors detected by the front camera in an <code>ARWorldTrackingConfiguration</code> . Vice versa, you can enable <code>isWorldTrackingEnabled</code> in an <code>ARFaceTrackingConfiguration</code> to benefit from 6DOF world tracking.</p>
<p>You can learn more about these APIs here:

Am I able to capture frames off additional feeds at the same time (not necessarily exactly synchronous). </p>
<p>|U03JSM190KX|:
Eg main at session happening on rear facing camera, additional video frames captured occasionally from front facing. </p>
<p>|U03JSM190KX|:
Maybe I've been fooled, see an ARKit 6 breakdown that says “Simultaneous front and back cameras with AR” - is this real?</p>
<p>|U03HWCCTAKT|:
We introduced new API to capture frames in higher resolution than your configuration’s video format: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession/3975720-capturehighresolutionframe">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsession/3975720-capturehighresolutionframe</a>. Those frames are captured from the same camera. Setting up additional cameras is not supported. We encourage you to file a feature request in Feedback Assistant: <a href="http://feedbackassistant.apple.com/">http://feedbackassistant.apple.com/</a></p>
<p>|U03HWCCTAKT|:
The sentence you quoted refers to the API I mentioned above. Not all of the features listed in the lower part on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/">https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/</a> are new additions in ARKit 6; this is meant more as highlighting ARKit’s capabilities in general.</p>

We're working on an AR experience that allows user to put AR objects in their surroundings and replay it later. We're saving the data on an ARWorldMap and archive it on the filesystem to be retrieved later. Everything works great on smaller areas with small ARWorldMap file sizes. However as user adds more stuff, the ARWorldMap file gets bigger and at some point, it takes so long or even impossible to relocalize using the big ARWorldMap files. I'm seeing slower relocalization on ARWorldMap files with 10 mb size.   Question: Is there like a known cap of how big ARWorldMap files can be to retain effectivenes of relocalization and the AR experience?  What can impact performance for AR relocalization other than lighting condition and the object textures that we're rendering (maybe area size? camera motion? features in the area?) since we're seeing frame drops on bigger ARWorldMap files.  Thanks!</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7GC4DEC|:
ARWorldMaps are optimized for room sized scenarios. If you exceed that limit then relocalization will stop working in certain areas as the map is not big enough any more to cover the whole area.</p>
<p>The frame drops sound related to the amount of content being displayed though. For that, feel free to provide more details through Feedback Assistant: <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com">https://feedbackassistant.apple.com</a></p>
