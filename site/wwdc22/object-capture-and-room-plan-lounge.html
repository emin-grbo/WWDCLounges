    Hi!  I'm just wondering if you have suggested guidance for capturing objects that are on a rotating platform, to minimize post-production work.  Is it advised to try to frame the platform out of the image as best as possible, to post-process each image and crop out the platform, wrap the platform in a similar color to the background, etc.?

Since the RoomCaptureSession owns the ARSessionDelegate, which is usually how the latest frame would be obtained.

I'm just wondering if you have suggested guidance for capturing objects that are on a rotating platform, to minimize post-production work.  Is it advised to try to frame the platform out of the image as best as possible, to post-process each image and crop out the platform, wrap the platform in a similar color to the background, etc.?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7GGBZDW|:
We suggest to use a uniform color platform which is different than the object and keep the object inside the frame, but as large as possible. Use object masking to make PhotogrammetrySession remove the background <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/photogrammetrysession/configuration-swift.struct/isobjectmaskingenabled">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/photogrammetrysession/configuration-swift.struct/isobjectmaskingenabled</a></p>
<p>For difficult objects you can also provide manual masks. Please see  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/photogrammetrysample/objectmask">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/photogrammetrysample/objectmask</a></p>
<p>|U03J20E7UBV|:
Thank you, &lt;@U03J7GGBZDW&gt;!  Since I have the camera on a tripod and object(s) on a platform, doing some degree of post-processing or masking might be a viable solution when passing the photos into the Object Capture API.</p>

<h4 id="how-can-i-crop-the-model-after-it-is-made">How can I crop the model after it is made?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HL4SJY5S|:
We provide a <code>Geometry</code> field on the model reconstruction <code>Request</code> that will allow you to specify the cropping region <em>during</em> the model creation step.  We show this flow in last year's WWDC session (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10076/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10076/</a>).  To recap, a GUI app can be made with the API that will let you request a preview model, arrange the reconstruction volume, and then get the cropped output.</p>
<p>We recommend cropping during reconstruction since this allows our algorithms to focus the texture and mesh resolution on areas that are being reconstructed.</p>
<p>Also note that this year we added the ability to specify an <code>OrientedBoundedBox</code> in the request to allow a more general cropping volume.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7GGBZDW|:
<code>RoomCaptureView</code> is a plug and play view that you can use in your app
<code>RoomCaptureSession</code> let’s you subscribe to updates using a delegate and gives you finer grain control over the surfaces and objects that RoomPlan detects.
RoomCapture session can be used for filtering out surfaces or objects and rendering them as per your liking.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7GBRQ0G|:
The captureHighResolutionFrame can be used by developers creating their own Object Capture app using ARKit to get higher quality images to be used for Object Capture. It captures the high-res camera feed, returning an ARFrame with a high-res image along with other information such as the camera tracking results.</p>
<p>|U03J7GBRQ0G|:
Using this API you just get the camera feed though and not the overlaid content in AR</p>
<p>|U03J20E7UBV|:
Thanks, &lt;@U03J7GBRQ0G&gt;!  Does the output file format (I'm not sure if it's a HEIC or PNG, etc.) also include depth/gravity data baked in?</p>
<p>|U03J7GBRQ0G|:
You simply get an ARFrame and can access the CVPixelBuffer through that to eventually save it to the format of your choice</p>

Another excellent question. It would be great to have you join us at the RoomPlan Q&amp;A session tomorrow where we can cover this and lots of other questions on this topic.</p>
<p>It all depends if you’re using <code>RoomCaptureView</code> or not: if you are, there’s no way of filtering out objects from live scan rendering, so you’ll have to do it prior to exporting to a USDZ. If you have your own custom view (using Data Only API), We’d recommend doing it directly in the live view (so that end users understand that objects won’t be part of the final USDZ)</p>

The Model (or mini-map as described) is not currently adjustable in the <code>RoomCaptureView</code>, but can be disabled optionally by setting <code>roomCaptureView.isModelEnabled = false</code> and a custom model could be implemented if desired using a custom visualizer.

Using RealityKit you can load the USDZ as an Entity and then perform evaluations on it. Please note that there is a known issue with Beta 1 on the scale of dimensions in a USDZ file.
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/loading-entities-from-a-file">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/loading-entities-from-a-file</a>

Thank you, are there any particular resources within RealityKit that I should start looking into?</p>

I have turned off different things in the configurations, like instructions. Is that what data-only API means or is that something else?</p>

Oh, sorry for the confusion. The data-only API is mainly referring to <code>RoomCaptureSession</code> and <code>RoomCaptureSessionDelegate</code> protocol, with which you can get <code>CapturedRoom</code> during the scan and apply textures yourself. For final model, you will also get CapturedRoom from <code>RoomBuilder.capturedRoom(from:)</code> to apply textures.</p>

In the <em>full</em> detail level we provide the following texture maps: <em>diffuse, normal, AO, roughness, displacement</em>. Displacement is useful for some use cases.</p>
<p>In case you do not need some of the texture maps you could try to output uncompressed USDA and individual texture maps in a folder (by providing a folder URL). That makes it easier to choose a subset of the texture maps.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HL4SJY5S|:
The <code>.bounds</code> <code>Request</code> should be used to get the initial reconstruction bounding box.  This can be used in an GUI iterative workflow as shown in the WWDC 21 Object Capture video to then send the desired reconstruction volume box for the reconstruction to use by adding it into the <code>Geometry</code> property of the <code>Request</code>.</p>
<p>Note that this year we added <code>OrientedBoundingBox</code> to allow more general reconstruction boxes (not axis-aligned).  We recommend to use the <code>.preview</code> <code>Detail</code> along with <code>.bounds</code> for this, but it should also be possible to use the point cloud as well.  The key is that the volume specified in <code>Geometry</code> is relative to the initial coordinate system defined by the <code>.bounds</code> <code>Request</code>.</p>
<p>Intermediate results in the session are cached, so subsequent requests should be faster than the initial ones as well.</p>

I have used a drone for photogrammetry that includes GPS and altitude in it's metadata. The resulting models are always reconstructed high in the Y axis as if it is using the altitude data. Does the API use altitude?</p>

This also seems to suggest that the APA can use GPS data to aid in reconstruction, but not return it. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/photogrammetrysample/metadata">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/photogrammetrysample/metadata</a></p>

The <code>PhotogrammetrySession</code> when provided with a folder will assume <em>all</em> image files in the folder are RGB images of the object to be reconstructed, so you cannot mix them all in one folder if you use the folder input init.  There is currently not a way to specify masks using the folder input to a session.</p>
<p>To provide masks, you will need to use the custom input <code>PhotogrammetrySession</code> that takes a lazy sequence of <code>PhotogrammetrySample</code>objects that you create yourself in your app.  You will have to load the images yourself in this case and they can be stored whereever you wish, in the same folder, in a database, etc.</p>

The dictionary key should be a string, but what data type should the value be added in? Float, double, int?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7GGBZDW|:
Yes providing GPS information is useful and can help with the reconstruction, especially for drone use cases.
We use the same formatting as ImageIO.</p>

<p>|U03HHNPM8M9|:
The API does not support to specify GPUs.

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7GGBZDW|:
yes if this value is enabled, but the samples don’t contain object masks, Object Capture attempts to automatically create a mask algorithmically. If it’s unable to create a mask, Object Capture reverts to reconstructing the object using the entire image.</p>

We use SceneKit to draw lines representing Wall edges. We want to stay with our wall capture method. But auto capturing everything else is enticing. I’ve plugged in a RoomCaptureSession into the app. I want to use point data to draw lines with SCNNodes. But when the callbacks get called(e.g. didUpdate), there does not seem to be any useful point data for a a door. Even with a high confidence level, in the didUpdate method when I look inside the CapturedRoom, I’m seeing 0 values for CompletedEdges, PolygonCorners and PolygonEdges. Is there a particular callBack method I should be using? It looks like didUpdate and didChange are the main methods that get called. But I’m not seeing any valuable point data in them.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHNVCZ19|:
You can use <code>transform</code> and <code>dimensions</code> paremeters to draw lines. The 4 corners can be inferred from those 2 parameters: the first column of the transform is the "right" vector, and second is the "up" vector. The fourth column is the position of the wall/door/opening/window/object Combining those unit vectors with the dimensions vector will give you the corners</p>

Thanks for the feedback. What is the desired upper limit for your use case? It would be great if you can provide more info about your use case if the current set-up is limiting, at Feedback Assistant <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com">https://feedbackassistant.apple.com</a> or developer forum <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/">https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/</a>.</p>
