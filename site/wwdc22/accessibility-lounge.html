    Awesome work on the Unity plugin - I can't wait to use it! While the session demo'd VoiceOver use with the plugin, is it safe to assume this will work with Voice Control as well? There's that old overlap of accessibility allowing convenience for those that want it and it'd be nice to allow players to do so with additional voice inputs etc.

</blockquote>
<p>Hi Klayton, a lot of this likely starts at the design stage. The best high-level recommendation we tend to give is to allow for any given label in a design to grow significantly, both in content and in size. In many cases this involves making content scrollable, or adapting horizontal layouts to become vertical at a particular text size. For the latter, I highly recommend checking out ViewThatFits, which is a new view in SwiftUI this year that lets you specify variations of views, allowing the framework to pick the best one depending on the available size.</p>
<p>I’ve also got some links that I highly recommend checking out if you haven’t already: an app challenge from last year, a couple WWDC sessions, as well as the “Text display” section in our Human Interface Guidelines.</p>
<p>If you have specific questions about making sure your app works great with Dynamic Type we’d be happy to answer those too!</p>

Thanks.  That's helpful.  I really wish some of these new layout tools were available in earlier OS versions or made available to the same set of devices as iOS 15.</p>
<p>For a single word that can't fit on one line, such as someone's name, does a streaming scroll (marquee) element seem better than breaking up that word into multiple lines?  Should it require an app-setting toggle to avoid motion issues for people sensitive to motion? 
I would say multiple lines are much more preferable than implementing marquees </p>

<p>Thanks for your question. Currently SwiftUI controls can be added to tab key loop with the <code>.focusable</code> modifier, thus also being able to be triggered by space key. 
Hi Eric, do you have example code for this? I have tried .focusable() for my image button. However, when press space key for it,  the Button action didn’t get hit? Does it also work for Link. Toggle …

<h4 id="what-attracted-you-to-working-at-apple-and-specifically-on-accessibility">What attracted you to working at Apple, and specifically on accessibility?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>For me personally, 1. I believe Apple is the best company to work for if you want to change the world and make it a better place with technologies 2. Solutions/products that help people with disabilities could be one of the most impactful things you could do with a known set of inputs/resources 3. Problems in accessibility are really really hard problems, and I get personal satisfaction solving them :slightly_smiling_face: 
I happened to meet someone who worked on this team when I was in school and managed to get an interview for an internship. I didn't get the internship, but I replied back a year later to see if they wanted interns for the next year, because I knew it'd be such a fit for me. The thought that someone was working on accessibility full time was so cool to me, and I knew it was something I wanted to do. I get to make stuff, basically for myself, I don't think I could find a cooler job :sunglasses: 
I've used Apple products since I was 10 years old and Steve Wozniak taught my 5th grade class how to use a Mac laptop. Having been born legally blind, accessibility has always been a passion of mine as it helps improve my quality of life. Since age 10, I've been all Apple, and I wanted to be a part of, and share with others, the amazing things that our technology has done to improve my life. 
I joined pretty much right from university. I was interested in accessibility research at the time and Apple just happened to need help making a newish product accessible (the iPhone). 
Testing and QA is what I already enjoyed doing. I’ve went most of my professional life searching for that missing additional element and I found it at Apple. I realized that found it more meaningful and fulfillment helping others by helping others by ensuring that our Accessibility features are always as expected. In addition, as a disabled person myself, I am able to provide quality feedback on how to improve or suggest new features that will make life easier for other physically challenged people like myself 
I’ve been using a Mac in one form or another since the 80s, and at every step of my vision loss, the product was there to meet me where I was at. The opportunity to work side by side with the people who created a huge part of my personal independence was a powerful dream. I have had this goal since I was in the 8th grade. You know those assignments “What do you want to do when you grow up?” Well, I still have the paper from that 8th grade exit assignment, and it says in my handwriting that I wanted to work for Apple. Decades later I wouldn’t change a thing. </p>

Are there patterns?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, as a low vision user, the most common pattern I've noticed is in Large Text support. It often doesn't exist, or if support does happen, it is often not in a readable way. 
I think sometimes when developers make assumptions about what I need they can sometimes miss the mark. Just because I have low vision doesn't mean I need a totally separate design. When I see apps present a totally different design for VoiceOver users, I am always a bit disappointed. We have so many tools to make almost any design accessible, and people want to enjoy those experiences similarly to how their able bodied friends and peers are experiencing them. Implement APIs to support built in settings we've provided instead, and you'll be headed in the right direction 
One thing I notice is when a developer uses custom UI with several elements on screen, they tend to forget about making  every single element accessible. For example, most of the important elements would be scannable with item mode and the ones at the bottom such as sorting items in a list buttons won’t be accessible </p>

<p>Yes, unless a particular UIView has its <code>semanticContentAttribute</code> set to <code>.forceRightToLeft</code> or if a SwiftUI View has its <code>layoutDirection</code> environment set to RTL 
In some specific cases like two columns content, navigating down the first  column before jumping to the second column may make more sense than a strict top-left-bottom-right. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>The most common issues I see when we do app audits are bad accessibility labels and improper groupings for VoiceOver users. Labels should be concise, and shouldn't include redundant information like the role (like the word button). And items should be grouped logically. The best advice I give developers is, think about how the information is "digested" visually. Is this group of labels/images conceptually one item when you look at it? Then it probably should be for VoiceOver users too. This isn't something we think about a lot, it's all implicit in the apps we use every day, but taking a step back to notice these things help a lot 
Here's a great talk on writing good accessibility labels: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/254">https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/254</a> 
Lack of support for Large Text sizes. I frequently see apps make an effort to be accessible with VoiceOver, but even apps that do a great job with that often do not have support for Large Text. 
Making a choice to use a cross platform development package without first investigating how accessibility will be implemented with that package frequently results in a really bad situation. Your customer might report an accessibility problem, and you may be unable to fix it if the frameworks don’t support our accessibility features. This has been the case for countless apps I have encountered so far. </p>

<p>Thanks Keith. There have been lots of improvements in accessibility of scientific materials . MathML for instance allows VoiceOver users to read mathematical expressions on the web and other documents. There is still a lot to do in making math and science more accessible to students and professionals with visual disabilities. In particular conveying graphical information such as diagrams, function graphs, etc. is still an area of research and development. </p>

<p>So in VoiceOver on macOS the headings rotor will be found using the VoiceOver modifier keyboard shortcut + the U key. This will pop open the available rotors and if you're on an element which has a headings rotor you can use the left and right arrow keys to find it in the rotor menu. The headings rotor will include the level of the heading when announcing each heading. </p>

<p>Great question. Yes, Switch Control can be configured to respond to external Bluetooth keyboard events!</p>
<p>Make sure your keyboard is paired to your iOS or iPadOS device, then head to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Switch Control &gt; Switches &gt; Add New Switch. Here you get to choose the switch source, so tap External.</p>
<p>Each key on your keyboard could be its own switch, but you have to add them one by one. When you activate a key on your keyboard, Switch Control will ask you to name it and then assign it to an action, this helps you keep track of all the switches you add. 
If you're able, I recommend setting up at least three switches if you're using a keyboard with Switch Control: Select Item, Move to Next Item, and Move to Previous Item. For these you could use the space bar and arrow keys respectively! 
Thanks Drew! This will make switch control development much easier 
Glad to hear it will help! :tada: </p>

<p>You can override/set accessibilityValue on the text view to return the entire text. 
For the character limit, you could post an announcement notification when the user starts to go over the limit that says something like "character limit reached". You can also add a hint to the text field that conveys the max number of characters. Also make sure that your counter of 90/100 is an accessibility element, so that VO users can focus on it manually if they want to know the character count </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Accessibility Focus State is gonna be the way go here! You can change the state value to true on an element and it will update VoiceOver focus to that element! <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/accessibilityfocusstate|https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/accessibilityfocusstate">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/accessibilityfocusstate|https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/accessibilityfocusstate</a> 
Does it make sense to change the focus when showing a new view in place of the old one on macOS? We have a list layout, clicking one of the items "pushes" a new view similar to a navigation controller. Currently VO loses focus and moves elsewhere. 
So if voiceover is really not going where you want in this instance I think you could do that. I would warn about using this too often though because jumping around the voiceover focus can be very distracting. If its a totally custom navigation system than in that instance you probably want to either do that or trying to post a layout change notification. Usually though we either let the system framework and voiceover to decide where best to go, or if your UI has a popup or an alert thats a great way to use focus state. 
I guess there’s a similar property as AccessibilityFocusState in NSAccessibility? I am having some issues to keep the element selected with tabulator keyboard navigation and VoiceOver focus in sync because I have to move the tab focus programmatically in some cases (for example when moving out of a WKWebView to some custom window UI elements below). 
&gt; trying to post a layout change notification.
Will posting a layout notification without passing in a view work? Or is there a way of doing this in SwiftUI? 
So if you change keyboard focus you can send a notification with NSAccessibilityFocusedUIElementChangedNotification to let voiceover know the focus changed. If you want to change voiceover focus from non-keyboard focus changes you can use NSAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification with a NSAccessibilityUIElementsKey <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/1534572-nsaccessibilitypostnotificationw?language=objc">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/1534572-nsaccessibilitypostnotificationw?language=objc</a> 
In that instance &lt;@U03JB2UUT46&gt; if you want to pass a specific element you would use focus state because there isn't really a view to pass it in SwiftUI 
Thanks &lt;@U03HKTXJ4KE&gt;, I‘ll try those notifications. I actually might need LayoutChangedNotification because the elements I‘m programmatically focusing are in a different window, so maybe the NSAccessibilityUIElementsKey is needed to be passed. 
I had a hard time to be able to access window elements in the title bar (if no NSWindowToolbar is used), in the toolbar if it is visible, web content in the WKWebView and those additional UI elements in a separate „Dock“ window below, but in the end it worked with adding views like NSWindow contentView.superview, contentView and the contentView of the separate window to NSWindow accessibilityChildren. Don‘t know if there‘s a better way, but it seems to work correctly now. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I usually say
1. Dynamic Type support will reach the largest audience
2. Add App Accessibility support will be most impactful for users who need to use ATs (Assistive technologies) - like VoiceOver,Switch Control, Voice Control — because often if app accessibility is NOT provided - they will have no way to access your app 
Other areas like checking for contrast, transparency, motion will have large impacts IF your app has areas that might be problematic (aka - you have light grey text on white backgrounds) and are usually not that much work to implement 
True true, I want to be sure our app is impactful for everyone so taking the small wins were we can. Thanks for the callouts here! </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I suspect you’d want to use UIFontMetrics to help here</p>
<p><code>`- (UIFont *)scaledFontForFont:(UIFont *)font maximumPointSize:(CGFloat)maximumPointSize;</code>
` 
In general, we would like to NOT cap font sizes, however there are cases within the UI that are very hard to grow given constraints. In iOS and iPadOS we will often use UILargeContentViewer (UIKit/UILargeContentViewer.h) to allow a long press to show text that’s can’t grow well 
In your case, it sounds like it would be reasonable to roll out support for larger sizes and overtime work to adopt the largest sizes. 
I'd reiterate that it's really not recommended to cap text sizes, unless the UI literally cannot grow without being unreasonable (like nav bars and tab bars, in which case use large content viewer like Chris said). Limiting text sizes will significantly impede low vision users from using your app properly. Definitely support what you can for now, but I strongly encourage you to work towards supporting all the sizes rather than capping them to a specific value! 
Yes! Supporting all font sizes is absolutely the plan! Just trying to make it more usable more quickly. Thank you for your answers! </p>

<p>You can also use the API in &lt;UIKit/UIFocus.h&gt;. FullKeyboardAccess uses the focus engine, so these may be used to customize the FKA experience. 
thanks, John! so, it seems like simply implementing accessibility for voice over does not automatically carry over to full keyboard?</p>
<p>is there any specific accessibility property we should use for keyboards? where you thinking I should use <code>canBecomeFocused</code> ? 
Right it does not, we do try to respect <code>accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction</code> and other accessibility methods like <code>accessibilityElements</code> but ultimately the focus engine is what determines the behaviour.
Yup! <code>canBecomeFocused</code>  is ultimately what the focus engine uses to decide what to focus. 
I was hesitant to use this boolean -- the wwdc '21 "Support Full Keyboard Access in your iOS app" session specifically calls out <em>not</em> to use <code>canBecomeFocused</code> as this has implications beyond accessibility in the app

Hi Eric! By “keyboard accessibility” here I’m not just referring to keyboard focus, but what happens inside a lazy grid when you press the arrow keys (or tab, actually.) Or are trying to multi-select within a grid (Shift + Arrow Key, or Shift + Option Key + Arrow Key).</p>
<p><code>NSCollectionView</code> and <code>NSTableView</code> can give you this out of the box (and you can see it in Finder or other native apps.) But this kind of keyboard accessibility — plus selection state handing — isn’t available in SwiftUI out of the box as far as I can tell.</p>

The increment/decrement equivalents are accessible by touch or keyboard on macOS…. Look up Mac VoiceOver’s “TrackPad Commander” feature for touch gestures.</p>
<p>To <em>increment</em> with a slider on macOS, you can use unmodified arrow keys in most scenarios. If the user wants to override the default key handling and force an “increment” they’d first “interact with” slider (VO+Shift+Down) and then increment (VO+Up or VO+Right in LTR languages contexts) </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Big question! If I'm reading this right, then I would start with making sure your design system is able to make all components accessible to the same level as the native platforms 
Then you need to transmute those paradigms in your system to the native platforms 
This is very similar to what we did with Unity accessibility plugins <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10151|https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10151">https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10151|https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10151</a> 
So there are Unity methods for everything from custom actions to dynamic type. Those get translated to the native iOS<br />
Thanks! :slightly_smiling_face: 
In addition to Chris' comments, I'll add:</p>
<p>&gt; What accessibility standards/assistive technologies would you recommend to take into account while building a design system?
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/|WCAG">https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/|WCAG</a> has a lot of really great guidelines. If your design system includes web technologies, there are automated tools to test some aspects of accessibility, like:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core">https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core</a></p>
<p>These tools can be run in a CI pipeline, allowing you to catch and fix accessibility issues as early as possible.</p>
<p>As far as which assistive technologies to test, VoiceOver is a good one, since often (but not always) if a web app is accessible with VoiceOver it is also accessible with other assistive technologies. But you should still test others! Full Keyboard Access (and even general keyboard navigability) is a good one. Another one to test with is Voice Control. 
Thank you Tyler! I've just submitted another question precisely about automated testing solutions, just a second before seeing your reply! :slightly_smiling_face: 
Tyler 
Great minds think alike :smile: 
Also make sure your design system requirements account for the superset of all available accessibility features.</p>
<p>There are API equivalents for many of these, like <code>isReduceMotionEnabled</code> for native Apple platforms and <code>@media (prefers-reduced-motion)</code> in Web. Likewise <code>isDarkerSystemColorsEnabled</code> vs <code>@media (prefers-contrast: more)</code></p>
<p>Not all features exist on all platforms though, so be sure to account for all in the design, and support the implementation where available. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes it should be announced but not immediately. There should be a period of quiescence so that your announcements are not interrupting typing feedback<br />
Thank you! 
You’ll get that announcement-without-interruption for free if you use an ARIA “live region” for the “5 items found” announcement. You don’t always need to use WebSpeech or SSML for general user interface notifications. 
We had a WWDC session cover live regions years ago, but it may be difficult to find now.</p>
<p>The incomplete gist of a live region is:</p>
<p><code>`&amp;lt;div role="status"&amp;gt;As the contents of this element are changed, screen readers will announce the new text automatically.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;</code>

</blockquote>
<p>Good question! I think your intuition is right here. For longer form reading content, some people prefer to adjust font size on the fly, as lighting conditions change or their eyes tire. For apps that are not for long form reading content, these controls are really not recommended in my opinion. As of iOS 15, we have per app settings where users can set font sizes per app, and they can be adjusted quickly with our control center module. So users already have a way to quickly adjust text sizes on the fly should they require it. Users are expecting to open your app and see the text size they have set globally (or per app if they've adjusted it), so adding a second control to your app just introduces unnecessary complexity </p>

<p>Hi Rob, there are several <code>speech</code> modifiers available for use with Text in SwiftUI, like <code>speechAdjustedPitch</code>, <code>speechAlwaysIncludesPunctuation</code>, <code>speechAnnouncementsQueued</code>, and <code>speechSpellsOutCharacters</code>. For changing language, you can override the <code>locale</code> environment on a Text view and it should do the trick. 
Sweet, I have never noticed these before. Thank you! 
Also note that since iOS 15, <code>Text</code> can natively support attributed string via both new markdown syntax "<code>Text("this is **bold **")</code> and <code>AttributedString</code> . So if you use those it should also work </p>

I <em>think</em> this is an Apple bug, not mine - the permission alert on accessing the camera doesn't read out the text explaining <em>why</em>  Should I worry/fix?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Andrew! If this alert is coming from the system, there shouldn't be anything you need to do to make it accessible. If you're finding it's not, please file a bug to us via Feedback Assistant. Note that the heading of the alert and the body are likely separate accessibility elements, and a user must move focus to the body in order to have it read, it won't all read automatically. This is by design 
After a solid half hour of testing, I <em>think</em> the problem may have been that it was iOS14 and/or it was my not understanding how to move through things with VoiceOver. I may have been doing a swipe <em>down</em> rather than left/right, to try to advance item. Anyway, I now am much more practiced at VoiceOver, have an even healthier respect for the people who designed it, and can not reproduce the problem.</p>
<p>(It's also really hard to reliably trigger the state of <em>Application has <em>not yet</em> been authorised for camera -</em> if you reboot the device whilst the alert is in front, it defaults to being disabled, not left ambiguous!) 
Glad you were able to get more familiar with VoiceOver! 
Hah! I just replicated this and it was indeed my misunderstanding voiceover. I'll record a little video as a reminder but the <em>short version</em> is:
1. I thought that <em>swipe down</em> advanced to the next control
2. Whilst a <em>slow</em> swipe down will take you through the elements of the alert, a <em>fast</em> swipe down will move the focus from the title to the button you end up on, without <em>having time</em> to say the sub-title 
I managed to trigger the application state on a test device where it would show this alert then another 10 minutes of playing around to realise the above sequence is what I'd been doing 
Hmmmm
I spoke too soon, maybe it's a thing about alerts.
The <em>swipe right</em> for <em>Select the next item</em> doesn't work in them. 
what happens when you swipe right? It should be a quick swipe to the right (a flick) and that'll move to the next item 
flicks up/down will activate whatever the current rotor item is 
OK, yeah I was trying to do that. I will have to get back to the state where the "Blah would like to access the camera" alert is shown and re-record with touches captured.</p>
<p>It <em>seems</em> that accessibility swipe right behaviour indeed doesn't behave normally no that particular alert 
ahh Rotor was on Characters not Containers 
I'll dive into this with more testing when have more time and log an issue if I prove out a problem. I'm confused by the Rotor, now I have it appearing. There are a lot more options on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204783">https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204783</a> than I see. My rotor only has
Headings
Characters
Words

Containers 
The rotor options are dynamic based on the type of control you're on, but you can also add a bunch more in VoiceOver settings   </p>

<p>Hi Shahla! I don't think there's a ton of special considerations you need to make for infinite scroll views. Assistive Technology users can typically discover and interact with these similarly to mainstream users. Just make sure that the content inside your scroll view is accessible!

<p>Thanks for the question!</p>
<p>One thing you could do is to make sure the section headers have "header" accessibility traits via <code>accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)</code></p>
<p>The second thing you could do is check out the <code>accessibilityRotorEntry</code> API to provide custom rotors for VoiceOver. This can allow VoiceOver users navigate your app more efficiently.

The visibly hidden items are not hidden from VoiceOver and so it's selecting them as you move through page items. How do I hide them from VoiceOver?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use <code>setAccessibilityElementsHidden</code> in UIKit or <code>.accessibilityHidden()</code> in SwiftUI
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615080-accessibilityelementshidden?language=objc">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615080-accessibilityelementshidden?language=objc</a> 
Just looked at how my UIKit code works. I have a hierarchy inside my main view (xib)</p>
<pre><code class="language-Swift">UISegmentedControl
UIScrollView
   UIView
       UIView backgroundImage
       UIView backgroundColor
       UIView backgroundShader
</code></pre>
<p>I'm just toggling <code>backgroundImage.isHidden</code> (etc) and relying on that to hide all the innermost controls 
what view contains the controls? 
you'd want to set accessibilityElementsHidden on the view that contains all the controls you don't want VoiceOver to see 
yeah I'm just trying that. Sorry for not being more explicit - the three named views in my little diagram contain all the controls (it's a complex screen, as are too many of the detail editors) 
Flicking between this and the alert thread ... I've actually replicated the lab problem as well and confirm you were right - it's speaking the "previous screen items" which is just weird.
<em>but</em>
have an added nuance from testing further (after adding the <code>accessibilityElementsHidden</code> code and then removing it)</p>
<p>If you tap the segmented control to change to the other elements being visible, VoiceOver is now correctly going through the elements of the page. Tapping it again to change back, it is still correct.</p>
<p>It seems that the explicit toggling of <code>isHidden</code> on the parent views is enough to fix things for VoiceOver <em>but</em> relying on the initial <code>isHidden</code> from the xib, at view load, is not. 
I'm loading these detail editor VCs with</p>
<pre><code class="language-Swift">func hostVC(_ vc:UIViewController) {

        for child in children {
            child.willMove(toParent: nil)
            child.view.removeFromSuperview()
            child.removeFromParent()
        }

        addChild(vc)

        vc.view.frame = view.bounds
        vc.view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

<p>So for this year VoiceOver will add support for Arabic (World), Basque, Bengali (India), Bhojpuri (India), Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Farsi, French (Belgium), Galician, Kannada, Malay, Mandarin (Liaoning, Shaanxi, Sichuan), Marathi, Shanghainese (China), Spanish (Chile), Slovenian, Tamil, Telugu, Ukrainian, Valencian, and Vietnamese! 
To query a list of languages, you can use the <code>speechVoices</code> property on <code>AVSpeechSynthesisVoice</code>

this will return you a list of all installed voices on disk. Note that a few of the new languages we are supporting do not have built in voices, so they will not show up in this list unless a user downloads them 
But you can basically iterate over this list and query the language property on the voice to figure out a list of languages that are available to the user

<p>As audio features are important to us, am also interested in ways to make this accessible (could have spent an entire day in that accessibility design lab!).</p>
<p>Would it make sense to use split output, with editing feedback via headphones and performance via speaker (or vice versa?). 
Thanks &lt;@U03JELM0ZNV&gt; - that's a neat reference I hadn't considered I'll definitely check it out.</p>
<p>Designing VO feedback specifically for headphones is definitely an interesting idea :thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face:<br />
That way we could use announcements to call out “30 seconds remaining” (or whatever) and give VO users some of the same countdowns. </p>
<p>I think really short announcements giving feedback might work too. Just have to make sure they're really targeted &amp; not too distracting…

<p>Hey Duncan! I encourage you to explore options of supervising the device yourself using Apple Configurator or other device management tools.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, I really like your use case and you should absolutely apply for an assessment entitlement. While I am not 100% positive on all of the requirements the review team goes though, I don't see harm in you applying!</p>

<a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/automatic-assessment-configuration/">https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/automatic-assessment-configuration/</a> 
Ok, will do.</p>
<p>In this very specific case, while I don’t regard it as “assessment”, I could probably argue it is formative assessment… The basic format is a quiz that lets students see if they know the names of other kids in the class/school… kinda getting increasingly important as around here (New Zealand) we now have in some schools open-plan learning environments with 90 kids and three teachers. That’s a lot of new names at the start of a school year. 
The real reason for this is… gently… I think turning on Guided Access is a bit confusing for a user who doesn’t ready know what it is. So cutting through to helping the user trigger it as part of a workflow in-app would be amazing. 
I’ve got to run to a lab appointment. Thanks for the great work your team does. Super appreciate it. 
Guided Access requires manual intervention so I agree it doesn't sound perfect for your use case. Autonomous Single App Mode seems more appropriate here. Thanks for hanging out in the lounge with us, enjoy your lab! </p>

<p>I don’t know if I would call it a favorite, but we do see a organizations making testing apps use ASAM mode effectively. When the test time starts, the device locks down, then releases access at the end of test time. There’s an 8 hour limit on ASAM mode, so it can’t be run forever either 
I’m thinking more is there an app you think of that does well in guiding someone in using ASAM for the first time, or one that is clever in how it handles restrictions for guided access

What kinds of things can I do to make it accessible using technologies like VoiceOver? Is PencilKit going to do a bunch of heavy lifting for me in a situation like this?</h4>

<p>Any UI that you're getting from PencilKit should get AX for free, like the palette controls etc. As far as accessibility work for the canvas, you'll need to asses what your users are going to use your app for, and build in accommodations around those use cases. Maybe that's announcement notifications if you're doing some sort of guided drawing to tell people if they are on track. It's always good to talk to blind users of your app if you can, and see what feedback they have. If you have more specific questions, feel free to post a question on the developer forums and tag it with accessibility, as the lounge closes soon! </p>
