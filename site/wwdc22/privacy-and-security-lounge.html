    Eryn W (Apple)  1 minute ago @Jean-Christophe Curious about your :x:. Is that not what you’re seeing?  I can't answer in the thread. I wanted to send you a sign because it wasn't my initiale question.  I didn't mean can multiple user generate multiple passkey for my app, I mean't can a single user gets in a situation where it has multiple passkeys generated ? (maybe on different device).  This relate to how and when the private key is save on device. If the server deny the authentication because he already know another public key for this user, how can the user use the correct passkey ? (or maybe this can never happen, and I'm interesting to understand why we are protected against such a thing, as passkey may not be already shared between my iphone and ipad and/or mac)

    I couldn't reply to the thread from my previous question. I'm still uncertain how to implement the fallback. The server sends the 401 and typically washes its hands of the request. So then is it on the browser to parse the 401 and initiate another request asking for the fallback option? That seems vulnerable to a replay. And, not that we do this, but if the initial request was not an AJAX request, the browser would just be sitting with a 401, right?

    Eryn W (Apple)  1 minute ago @Jean-Christophe Curious about your :x:. Is that not what you’re seeing?  I can't answer in the thread. I wanted to send you a sign because it wasn't my initiale question.  I didn't mean can multiple user generate multiple passkey for my app, I mean't can a single user gets in a situation where it has multiple passkeys generated ? (maybe on different device).  This relate to how and when the private key is save on device. If the server deny the authentication because he already know another public key for this user, how can the user use the correct passkey ? (or maybe this can never happen, and I'm interesting to understand why we are protected against such a thing, as passkey may not be already shared between my iphone and ipad and/or mac)

</blockquote>
<p>&gt; If passkeys are stored in iCloud Keychain, is it right to assume that they sync between multiple (Apple) devices?
Yes, that’s exactly right.</p>
<p>&gt; What if a device including its stored keys are compromised?
Then whoever compromised that device has access to the passkeys! It’s really important to think hard about what this means: that someone with physical access to a device has gained access to the device’s passcode.</p>
<p>Please compare this threat model to the more common, prevalent threat model of online phishing, password compromise via a website leak, and password reuse.</p>
<p>&gt; Would it be recommended to create a passkey per device for easier revocation?
No. Not only is this not possible with passkeys, but it would inconvenience the user. Replacing passwords for people means giving them a delightful, fluid experience.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The recovery method for an account is independent of the authentication mechanism. Websites are welcome to continue to use the same recovery methods they use today, such as sending a link in an email to create a new passkey</p>
<p>Recovery will likely be a much less common scenario with passkeys though, as they’re guaranteed to be saved by the device and there’s nothing for a human to forget</p>

Thank you! :green_heart:</p>
<p>&gt; I’m curious to know what the stance would be from your side on Sign in with Apple vs passkeys?
We don’t think of this as a conflict!</p>
<p>Sign in with Apple is a privacy-preserving federated authentication system. It makes it really easy for a user to get up-and-running, and for your app or website to onboard a user.</p>
<p>Passkeys are a <em>replacement for passwords</em> that are <em>far more secure than passwords</em>.</p>
<p>This distinction might seem subtle at first, but it’s really key — Sign in with Apple gives your user an <em>account</em>. Passkeys are an authentication technology that replace passwords.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The “identity” for a passkey is actually a hash of the public key. So if you created two passkeys for the same user name, they’d have different public keys. You’d end up with two public keys.</p>
<p>This is dissimilar to passwords in iCloud Keychain, whose “identity” is the literal username.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Great question! For devices that don’t support passkeys, you’ll likely want an alternate method of sign in, which may take the form of something like a magic link or a backup password/2FA method. This will become less common with time, as more devices and platforms support passkeys</p>

<p>In WebAuthn with security keys, it is already expected that websites will have multiple valid credentials for an account (i.e. one per physical security key). This is also true when using passkeys, as a user may have one passkey for an account saved in their iCloud Keychain, and another passkey saved for the same account on another platform.</p>

<p>The first step what we’re all at now is to start supporting passkeys on websites and apps. If we start doing this, we can offer this capability to customers. User interface patterns will emerge, and we’ll all be able to ramp up how many folks are encouraged to switch to passkeys.</p>
<p>The first step is adopting the technology.</p>

<p>You can sign in to an account on a device running iOS 16 or iPadOS 16 using a passkey from another device, including devices on other platforms, even without iCloud Keychain. However, passkeys cannot be created on Apple devices without iCloud Keychain turned on</p>
<p>Saying that another way:
• You cannot create a passkey on an Apple device without iCloud Keychain setup. When attempting to register a passkey, the user will see a screen asking them to turn on iCloud Keychain.
• You <em>can</em> use cross-device passkey sign in to sign in to an account on an Apple device without iCloud Keychain. For example, if you have a shared iPad without iCloud Keychain, users can use the passkey from their iPhone to sign in to their respective accounts</p>

<p>That is a best <em>security practice</em>, yes. However, that might not be the right answer from a <em>usability</em> perspective, especially at this time, during the transition.</p>
<p>Disabling password-based logins will be safer in a world with more and more devices compatible with passkeys. To start, you might want the user to keep their password around for signing in on devices without passkey compatibility.</p>

<p>Passkeys are happening, across the industry. People have already used their devices to replace older ways of doings things, and now it’s happening with passwords. The wide industry support means that there’s a really great chance that this succeeds.</p>
<p>People hate passwords. Constantly forget them. Feel guilt about not using them properly. Passwords are honestly pretty unpleasant.</p>
<p>This is a chicken and egg problem. Users have a right to be skeptical about this — we, collectively as an industry, haven’t shown them that passkeys are awesome <em><em>yet</em>.</em> Your organization can be on the earlier side of making this industry-wide transition happen, or on the later side.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you can absolutely utilize Private Access Tokens even if you don't currently have CAPTCHAs. However, it is important to make sure you still support clients that can't respond to the 401 challenge.</p>
<p>In general, you can send the 401 challenge to see if the client will respond with a valid token. That let's you know for sure that they're a legitimate client. Not getting a token doesn't mean for sure that they're not a valid client, though — even iOS 16 clients can get rate-limited and sometimes won't return a token.</p>
<p>If you do have a CAPTCHA system, you can fall back to it if you don't get a token quickly. But you can also have a fallback to a two-factor auth system, or requiring more user info. Or, if you're simply being overwhelmed by what looks like fraudulent activity, you can prefer letting the clients with tokens through.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the follow-up!</p>
<p>Your 401 challenge can either come from your main resource load — in which case you should also send a body with the response of the page to show — or it can be in response to separate connection request that you trigger using javascript, etc.</p>
<p>A client that can't fetch a token, or doesn't know about this auth type won't respond to the 401 at all with any auth type.</p>
<p>So, if this was your main resource load, a client that supports tokens would fetch a token and return it to you before loading the page; and a client that doesn't support tokens or can't fetch one, would load the page returned with the 401.</p>
<p>If this was a secondary load triggered by (for example) javascript, you could have a heuristic to recognize when the client isn't responding to that challenge, or have it load some content based on body of it's response.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s important to prevent “replay attacks” when your server is receiving tokens. iOS and macOS won’t ever send a token multiple times, but your server still needs to prevent this behavior.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can do this:
1. Remember what tokens you’ve received. This is a classic approach to replay prevention where you have a database, which may be shared across your server instances, to keep track of token spending. The downside here is the complexity of maintaining this shared database.
2. Make each token sign a unique value! That way when you receive a token, you can just check it against what you expect. To do this, you include a 32-byte “redemption_context” in your challenges.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Neither Apple nor your token issuer gets to see what the client is accessing! There are two cool ways this is made private:</p>
<ol>
<li>The token challenge includes the server name, but before the token request is sent to the Apple attester or the issuer, the RSA blinding operation obfuscates all of the content. When the token issuance completes, the client transforms it so the server can recognize the token, but the issuance flow cannot recognize it.</li>
<li>Tokens are fetched in batches and are cached by the client, so not every token issuance corresponds in time to a server requesting a token.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="am-i-right-that-sending-a-token-challenge-with-a-unique-redemption_context-prevents-client-side-caching-and-a-new-token-is-always-fetched">Am I right that: sending a token challenge with a unique <code>redemption_context</code> prevents client-side caching (and a new token is always fetched)?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>That's right — a unique redemption context means that the client can't cache, and needs to fetch a new token.</p>
<p>If you have an empty redemption context, the client will fetch batches of ~5 tokens at a time.</p>
<p>One subtlety here is that you <em>could</em> use a redemption content for multiple challenges. Let's say, you have a context that you use for all requests that come from a given region, etc. In that case, it's theoretically possible for the clients to recognize that the challenges have a matching context, and optimize things by fetching a batch.</p>

<h4 id="faq-how-do-private-access-tokens-relate-to-the-devicecheck-attestation-apis">FAQ: How do Private Access Tokens relate to the DeviceCheck attestation APIs?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The attester for Private Access Tokens is checking a lot of the same things as DeviceCheck. There are a few key differences, however:</p>
<p>• Private Access Tokens work both from an app and through web browsers, like Safari; DeviceCheck only works through your app.
• DeviceCheck requires that your server checks in with an Apple Server. Private Access Tokens are publicly verifiable, and don’t require your server to communicate with any other server on the validation path.
• Private Access Tokens uses a standard protocol model that will allow other platforms to define their own attesters, so your servers don’t need to write specific code to handle different platforms and operating systems.
• Private Access tokens only work when the user is logged into a device with an Apple ID, and the Apple ID is in good standing.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="faq-can-tokens-be-redeemed-across-multiple-websites">FAQ: Can tokens be redeemed across multiple websites?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! This is up to how you send your token challenges.</p>
<p>The “origin_info” field in the challenge defines which servers can receive tokens associated with this challenge. If it’s empty, then the client can cache tokens for the token issuer and use them across any website that leaves the origin info empty. The origin info can just include one hostname if you want it to only apply to your server, or it can include a list of hostnames to work with multiple.</p>
<p>Note that the actual server that sends the challenge <em>must</em> be listed in the origin_info field if it is non-empty.</p>

<p>In general for Passkeys (which is different from this Q&amp;A session on Private Access Tokens), please sign up for an Authentication Services lab for this Friday, or ask on the developer forums.</p>
<p>This particular question was addressed during the Q&amp;A for passkeys, too!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>You cannot use the Native API for applications that will be distributed outside the AppStore as the entitlement is only available that way.</p>
<p>However the Rest API as well as the JS API are options that are available for all platforms including macOS apps that ship outside of the AppStore.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Important to note that an App in the App Store is also required for Sign in with Apple to work on that configuration.
Even if the application is marked as "Not for Sale" in the developer portal.</p>

<p>(And for Germany, the Apple Page also says 13. It would — at least — be a good thing the users got a useful message like “you are not old enough”)</p>
<p>Thank you for that feedback &lt;@U03J4CWFAN8&gt;!
It is really useful to know that we have a string that might mislead users and developers.</p>
<p>Would you mind filing a Feedback Request with this information?</p>
<p>I absolutely will. And also it would be good to understand what the age in my region is, if the age on the Apple page is wrong …</p>

<p>The list is populated with apps that register themselves as handlers of URLs with the <code>otpauth</code> scheme. This doc talks through how to do that for your app. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app|https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app|https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app</a></p>

<p>Hi Jaime, the <code>ASAuthorizationController</code> APIs have existed since iOS 13.0. New this year in iOS 16.0 is the ability to specify <code>preferImmediatelyAvailableCredentials</code> when calling <code>performRequests()</code>. On older releases <code>performRequests()</code> does not take any parameter.</p>
<p>The Account Authentication Modification Extension was introduced in iOS 14.0</p>
<p>Thank you, perhaps I</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We got a moment to catch up with the team responsible for this and they sent us back with an answer for you here:
&gt; The new API of LocalAuthentication is perfect for protecting this type of refresh tokens. Under the hood this data gets stored in the keychain, and there aren’t any penalties (performance or otherwise) in using the SEP protection it affords; this simply binds the key and the data to a specific device.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The secure enclave is technology behind a number of our APIs, some of which by design allow multiple components of the system to sign with a key, while others allow restricting a private key for use by solely the application that owns it.  Please refer to the API documentation for your specific usecase!</p>
