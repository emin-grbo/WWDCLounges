    Before I download the beta… is there an option to revert to iOS 15-and-earlier style lock screens that take up the entire view?  Some of us don’t put people on the lock screens, but landscapes or architecture, and we don’t mind notifications taking up the whole view.  In some countries, particularly where Islam is the dominant religion, putting someone’s face on the phone would be grounds for chastisement or arrest, so they're not going to find this new view terribly useful.

    Is there a maximum (or recommended max) size for a timeline, or is it more of a time limit for timeline generation?

Is that an actual limit somewhere? I know there’s a limit on how long we can take generating a timeline, but for a simple widget the difference between 200 entries and 500 is negligible. Maybe it’s memory?   (Fun bonus complication: I have to limit my Mac widget to 100 entries because it seems to fail or “get stuck” way more often — does macOS actually have lower limits for widget timeline generation?

    Is WidgetCenter.shared.reloadTimelines rate limited on our behalf, or would triggering that 10x in 1 second (just an example lol) cause it to attempt getTimeline 10x? Do I need to be super careful about how often this can get called in a short amount of time (for example in response to database changes) or does it work similar to UIView.setNeedsLayout which will only result in one execution after a bit of a delay?

Is that an actual limit somewhere? I know there’s a limit on how long we can take generating a timeline, but for a simple widget the difference between 200 entries and 500 is negligible. Maybe it’s memory?   (Fun bonus complication: I have to limit my Mac widget to 100 entries because it seems to fail or “get stuck” way more often — does macOS actually have lower limits for widget timeline generation?

No, just the accessory family widgets. It'll be an empty view in system widgets</p>

System widgets are always opaque</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
Good question!</p>
<p>|U03JRR4R3CY|:
Ok I will make a feedback suggestion then, it would be great if the small, medium and large widgets could also have the same style background as the the system’s files and clock widgets :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
The system will update your relative date text every second, or with whatever fidelity is needed for the current style</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
That way, you can get secondly updates with only a single timeline entry</p>
<p>|U03JRR4R3CY|:
Great, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03JRP87THN|:
So the lock screen widgets can get updates every second if needed?</p>
<p>|U03HHHJT28K|:
Relative time will update every second if it’s showing seconds, without needing the widget itself to update.</p>

Same updating applies to the new ProgressView option.</p>

<p>|U03JRP87THN|:
Thank you!</p>
<p>|U03HHHJT28K|:
If you use it in a <code>.background</code> then the size of the view it’s applied to will be the size of the background too. Which can be smaller than the size of the widget.</p>

<p>|U03HHHK57K5|:
It has not changed for WidgetKit but is slightly different from ClockKit (for Complications). ~15 minutes is about right but please see this article for more details <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/keeping-a-widget-up-to-date">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/keeping-a-widget-up-to-date</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
Are you saying you’d like to sync user selections of intents between phone &amp; watch?</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
That’s not possible, but seems like a good idea! Please file some feedback!</p>
<p>|U03JELPN197|:
The user of our app are using Phone and Watch a lot, and we have Complications / Widgets for Calories, Activities, Steps and more. Sometimes they track Activities on the Watch, sometimes they add Food on the Phone. The user expects that if the add something on one device that the Widgets / Complications update instantly on their other device.</p>
<p>|U03JELPN197|:
And ofc we already have Siri Intents to add Foods for example</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
You can use WatchConnectivity or other data sync frameworks to ensure that both devices are able to communicate their inputs. Your watchOS and iOS apps can both request the widget to get reloaded after the data syncs between the two</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
The WidgetKit framework doesn't provide any utilities to help sync data or entries, though. That'll need to happen as part of your app.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
After you have new data sync'd, you can request that the system reloads your widget timelines with <code>WidgetCenter.shared.reloadTimelines(ofKind: ...)</code></p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
Check out <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/keeping-a-widget-up-to-date">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/keeping-a-widget-up-to-date</a></p>
<p>|U03JELT4UC9|:
It does refresh eventually, but the system decides when.
However, before refresh happens, the content has become irrelevant to the user</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
It's typically pretty immediate, unless you've exceeded reload quotas. Please file a feedback if you don't believe that's the case, we'd be happy to look in to it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
Users can specify that they want all widgets redacted or not on iOS under Settings -&gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode. Complications can be individually configured on watchOS under Settings -&gt; Display &amp; Brightness -&gt; Always On</p>
<p>|U03HAV8SRHC|:
Applications can also specify settings for your app and then set redaction in code, on or off. This would allow you to provide your users with fine grain control if required.</p>

Yes, there are limits. You can use background download tasks to save runtime. The system will carry out your network request and wake your extension again once it's completed.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
You can create a widget with minute and hour hands in WidgetKit for sure! You'll want to specify a once a minute timeline when your extension is asked for a timeline to make sure your time stays up to date</p>
<p>|U03JPJ277SQ|:
There’s something I’m still not clear about. You’re saying that I can provide a timeline with data at every minute?
How’s this not hitting the system update budget? I saw you answered something about this in some other question. &lt;@U03HHJ4LRU2&gt;</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
The budgeting cares much more about the runtime your extension gets (and therefore the amount of times you reload your timeline), not the number of entries you provide. Something like a clock is <em>highly</em> predictable, so you can provide many entries in a single wake of your extension.</p>
<p>|U03JPJ277SQ|:
That’s great. Thanks.</p>
<p>|U03HVF46TEJ|:
Is there a limit to how many entries we should put in a timeline or a limit on how much processor time we have to return a timeline? In the past, I've tried to return a timeline with per-minute updates but any more than around 100 entries/minutes will fail.</p>

<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
Hi Samuel. Since you know when the value will change, tou can have the system reload your timeline by using the after(__:)_ refreshPolicy
(See <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/keeping-a-widget-up-to-date">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/keeping-a-widget-up-to-date</a>)</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
Be aware that if you try updating your widget every minute or two, you will likely use up your refresh budget quickly, and the widget will stop refreshing</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
There was a video from WWDC 2021 that went into budgets a little more, check it out!</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
I'm not very familiar with web sockets in particular, but you can also use background URL sessions to have the system carry out network requests and wake your widget when it has been completed</p>
<p>|U03JR73TEKX|:
Thanks &lt;@U03HKV0T82Y&gt; and &lt;@U03HHJ4LRU2&gt;! I’ll definitely check out that session from last year. The lock screen got me excited to make a widget for the first time. So amazing they mostly just work on all of the platforms!</p>
<p>I was just reading about the background networking stuff. It seems like I won’t be able to use web sockets for that. I’ll have to see if there’s a way to download the data using a background session instead.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
That’s a great question!
Typically the extension doesn’t request data from the app. Instead, the app would know there’s new data, and tell WidgetCenter to reload the widgets. The app could have saved data to the file system (shared app container) for the extension to read from &amp; display</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
It sounds reasonable to alternatively have the app save out the access token and then have the extension do the networking.
Just be sure that the extension can respond to getTimeline() in a reasonable timeframe (seconds)</p>
<p>|U03K2PYH95E|:
Okay thanks. I was just interested if there was something similar to WCSession for WidgetKit.</p>
<p>Our use case is that we show the status of your car in the widget. Like if it is locked and the current range etc.
And we want this data to be up to date when the user looks at the widget. And the user might not open the iOS app for some time.</p>
<p>So then I guess we have 2 options.
Either make a push notification to iOS app when the state changes and have it update the shared data for the widget.</p>
<p>Or have the widget update itself regularly and then build some api client into it.</p>

<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
Doing this in your extension seems like a bad idea – your extension could be running for only a short time and then killed by the system once we have the timeline. There’s no way to predict when it or other devices extensions are running.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
This is technically safe to do, but your TimelineProviders may be created and not queried - if they system is querying what widgets you have available, for example, we'll create all your widget configurations, which then create your TimelineProviders. We may not be fetching your widget timelines then, so you'd be fetching your data and spending some of your runtime budget unnecessarily.</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
I'd recommend waiting until the timeline fetching methods are called to load the needed data. You can certainly cache it to avoid redundant loads between requests, though!</p>
<p>|U03JG18LGAG|:
The background of the question is not about data loading but about accessing CoreData. Before  reading/writing to it we need checked if a migration is necessary and if it is, then perform it.</p>
<p>|U03JG18LGAG|:
So would you recommend to better check (and migrate if necessary) explicitly in the getSnapshot and getTimeline method?</p>
<p>|U03JG18LGAG|:
Or am I overthinking this? Would it be sufficient to only check for the migration in the getSnapshot method, if it is always called before the getTimeline method?</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
I don’t see why init isn’t a totally reasonable place to do that.</p>
<p>|U03JG18LGAG|:
Maybe it could become an issue if in future releases the TimelineProvider implementation and system usage is changed? So when it is not the default <em>init</em>() anymore but with e.g. other parameters.</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
I think getSnapshot and getTimeline would be the right place to do those - don't assume a guaranteed order between them though, you'd want to check in both methods. In general, avoid work specific to providing views in your <code>init</code>  and wait for those methods to be called instead. Your TimelineProvider may be created much more often then it's actually asked for views and entries.</p>

You’re right that the extension could be called before the app is, after an app update.

<code>IntentTimelineProvider</code> and <code>TimelineProvider</code> is a protocol, so you could have it implemented as a class instead of a struct.</p>
<p>|U03JG18LGAG|:
Is it safe to implement the TimelineProvider as a class? I am wondering because in every sample code that I have seen it is always a struct.</p>
<p>|U03J7BAGWFJ|:
If you do use a class, you should be careful about any state you set for sure.  The intent with the methods on the provider are to be stateless, so it matches better with a struct in that sense.</p>
<p>|U03JG18LGAG|:
Maybe it does even make more sense to use a class then. Because if the same instance would call the getSnapshot or getTimeline again and the previous asynchronous combine call would not be finished yet, then it could be cancelled before starting a new one.</p>

Well do keep in mind the configurations of the Intent across calls could also be different, so keep that into consideration as well.</p>

Thanks!</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
You can certainly have a data model outside of your timeline providers that is shared between them, like a singleton. It can cache everything you need after the first load so that multiple widgets will benefit from whatever preparation it has done. After your widget content has been fetched, the extension is typically terminated, so there's no need to watch for a notification that it has ended to free up your resources</p>
<p>|U03HMEM4TM5|:
Is it guaranteed to be terminated, though? I wouldn’t want to exhaust the widget budget</p>
<p>|U03HMEM4TM5|:
(or worse, hold on to a SQlite database transaction that prevents the app from checkpointing)</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
It's not necessarily terminated, but the process is suspended shortly after the last timeline fetch occurs. I think your best bet is ensure your transaction has closed and flushed before calling completion on the timeline methods</p>
<p>|U03HMEM4TM5|:
The problem is, closing the transaction is the thing that is required to happen after all other readers are done. The transaction is what enforces consistent caches that can be reused across different widgets</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
Hm, I see. I'm not sure that I have enough context on SQLite to be very helpful. I'd suggest maybe reading all the data you need in to memory upfront and closing your transaction afterward, but that could also be costly depending on the amount of data.</p>

Is that an actual limit somewhere? I know there’s a limit on how long we can take generating a timeline, but for a simple widget the difference between 200 entries and 500 is negligible. Maybe it’s memory?   (Fun bonus complication: I have to limit my Mac widget to 100 entries because it seems to fail or “get stuck” way more often — does macOS actually have lower limits for widget timeline generation? Or maybe the process is way more throttled and thus more likely to time out?)</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7BAGWFJ|:
Hi Christopher.  Yes, there are limits.  You should be able to have as many entries as you’d like, but be aware of the content that’s contained within them - if they each have unique and different images, you may find that the number of entries you can use are more limited.  Essentially it’s limited by the overall size of the final content that’s generated.</p>
<p>There are also time constraints on generating content that we place on widget authors.  The more entries you have (ie. 1000), the more likely you are to run into constraints against the time allotment of generating your timeline.</p>
<p>|U03HVF46TEJ|:
Thanks. Is there a way to tell what limit(s) I'm hitting? In the debugger, remotely, anywhere?</p>
<p>|U03KC4368BS|:
&lt;@U03J7BAGWFJ&gt; Interesting. I am generating a few images using UIGraphics, but I am then caching them in-memory and reusing the same UIImage on subsequent entries. Would WidgetKit consider those "unique and different" images since it's not caching SwiftUI.Image or an Asset?</p>
<p>|U03J7BAGWFJ|:
We dedupe images where possible for efficiency.  There are scenarios where we do and where we don’t.  As long as you’re referencing the same image, I would expect things to behave as you’d expect.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
You should have your app &amp; extension belong to the same App Group, at which point they can share a data container for file system access. Your app can write to disk (sqlite, json, …) and ask WidgetCenter to reload your widgets. The extension can read that data on disk to create the widget UI</p>
<p>|U03J07GGVDK|:
Thanks. :pray:
For the shared image folder, if I’m building the directory path to an image file like this in the app main bundle: <code>"FolderName/\(face)/\(color)/_\(suffix)"</code>  do I need to prepend something like ~/ or ../.. in front when trying to load the same image from the extension?</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
I think you can specify the bundle UIImage(named: inBundle:). Or you could have a shared framework that contains the assets. Or maybe you need NSFileManager’s containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier: ?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
Please try to use opaque fill colors and text as much as possible! You can provide contrast between your own layers with varying greyscale values. Our own first party widgets were not updated to follow this guidance in time for seed 1, so don't follow their example.</p>
<p>We are actively investigating contrast and legibility issues. It's intended that any opaque color is legible. The system treatment to your content may change</p>
<p>|U03HVF46TEJ|:
Thanks, good to know! So generally we should stick to Color.primary and .secondary for everything?</p>
<p>|U03HHJ4LRU2|:
<code>Color.secondary</code> resolves to a transparent white at the moment; we're investigating if there could be some improvements to make this easier. The accessory Gauge, for example, uses .white for the dot and .black for the track.</p>
<p>|U03HVF46TEJ|:
Oh right, we use all shades of gray. Thanks!</p>
<p>|U03HVF46TEJ|:
And for the record: it would be super useful if Color.secondary resolved to some a standardized opaque gray we should use for “secondary” content, especially because that makes code sharing with full color widgets easier. </p>

<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
You should be able to tell in Console. If things are black it usually means a crash either on us on our end, or in the extension and we’re unable to read any views from it.
Be aware that images are newly restricted in size now – to about the same dimensions as your widget. Unlimited image sizes were causing issues before, so we’ve capped them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7BAGWFJ|:
Yes, if you’d like to share data between your widget extension and container application, you’ll want to do that via a shared app group container or use the network to pull the latest data for both.   Be careful if using the file system that if both processes (your extension and app) are running at the same time, accessing and/or mutating any shared cache data is safe for access.</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
SQLite is a reasonable option. It supports the scenario of one writer process (the app) and readers (the widget extension). With SQLite’s WAL I believe the single writer won’t block the reader at all.</p>
<p>|U03HKV0T82Y|:
A small SQLite schema could be used solely for the purpose of sharing data with the extension</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J7BAGWFJ|:
Yes, they can be rate limited and they may be coalesced by the system.  But depending upon your timing, you should also only call it when necessary.</p>
<p>If you flood the system with a bunch in a short duration, you may exhaust your allocated refresh budget quickly.  Sometimes you may want to do that, for example, if you were updating scores for a sports game.  However, other times you should probably be more exacting with it to ensure a good experience for your users.</p>
