    In our app we have single IAP subscription group with introductory offer (free trial). We see an uptick in people complaining they are charged right away. We suspect it has something to do with family sharing we have enabled just recently.   Two related questions: 1) If one member of the family receives introductory offer, can another member of the family receive one or will he be charged right away? In other words - is it tracked per family or per user basis. 2) If it's one introductory offer per family - there is code tutorial that suggest to parse all transactions in receipt to verify if user has previously used introductory offer. Will family members see transactions done by other members of the family?

    Can a SKAD ad actually have more than one fidelity ? Apple developer documentation suggests that ad networks have to choose one option of either 1. “StoreKit-Rendered Ads - App Store product page, rendered by StoreKit” 2. “View-Through Ads - Custom, provided by ad network” Providing those rendering options works quite differently on the device, so I’m not sure they could happen simultaneously for the same ad impression. I'm referring to this document: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/signing_and_providing_ads|https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/signing_and_providing_ads  This question came up when reviewing oRTB spec, which defines fidelities as an array: "SKAdNetwork API starting from version 2.2 supports multiple ad presentation options specified by the fidelity-type parameter of the SKAdNetwork signature. This holds parameters used to generate the signature that would be different for each fidelity type supported."  https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/openrtb-guide?hl=en|https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/openrtb-guide?hl=en

And honestly, all I want to know is “which productID is the user currently subscribed to.”    Maybe I’m just confused, but there seems to be A LOT of information retrieved in the sample code, but none of it is easily used to answer my question.  I can tell if the user EVER purchased my subscription (but that’s not terribly helpful - it’s like my wife asking me if I’m subscribed to Sports Illustrated - and I reply by saying YES - but in fact that was 20 years ago when I was in college.)  I can tell if the user is ENTITLED to my subscription (but that’s not helpful either - because it lists ALL of the subscriptions within the group and doesn’t single out the one which I’m ACTUALLY paying for in the moment.)  OK, so bottom line I’m just begging for a simple answer to a simple question:  which product ID is my user currently paying for.  Bonus points for also telling me when that subscription expires, and whether or not they’re in a billing retry or grace period.  Maybe the info is in there somewhere, but I’m all over the map with Transactions, RenewalInfo, and it’s ALLLL confused because I’m using Sandbox Testers (my app hasn’t been approved for distribution yet.)

    I’m going through App Submission for the 1st time - and I’ve got some confusion regarding how to associate my 4 in-app autoRenewable subscriptions to my app.  The AppStoreConnect page states that my 1st subscription must be submitted with a new app version, and then once the binary &amp; 1st subscription has been submitted, only then can additional subscriptions be submitted.   I got a rejection from AppReview because only 1 of my 4 subscriptions have been submitted.  So, is it true then that I have to submit the binary first, and then all 4 of my subscription IAPs immediately thereafter?

    Is there sample code on how to verify a StoreKit2 JWS server-side? Either in Swift, or in other popular server languages.  The x5c claim isn’t very widely used outside StoreKit in my experience &amp; there’s a fair amount of misinformation online about it. Specifically I’ve seen a number of people suggest only validating the first or last certificate in the chain. Which … isn’t right. Many JWT libraries don’t support it either.

    Our company has 8 brands, each one catering to specific user groups with different needs.  We would like to have the same underlaying app development for all brands and publish them as different apps in the App Store. With pertinent UI customizations to match each brand, but keeping the same overall UX.  Due to rule "4.3 Spam" from App Store Review Guidelines we are currently forced to have a single app publised in the App Store for all of our bands. And then users needs to choose a brand after install.  This provides a diminished experience for our users because it's important that users can discover our apps by themselves in the App Store. Also, as need to include information for all brands, all users see information that is not relevant to them and can be confusing.  The addition of Custom product pages may alleviate the situaion but is not ideal as it does not really help with discoverability within the App Store.  We are aware of the need to have rule "4.3 Spam" keep the App Store a safe place and to provide the best experience to our users.  But we would also work with Apple to find a way to be able to offer our users the best possible experience by providing them separate published apps in the App Store with different Bundle IDs. And thus providing the best journey for users since even before they install our apps.  Thank you!

Besides the fact that it would be nice if external TestFlight review was as fast as regular App Review, one issue is when we have a critical bug, we are able to get an update out to production users quickly (even without needing an expedited review), but it can take ~24 hours for the same update to make it to external TestFlight testers due to the longer review process. It would be really nice to have it such that if an app gets approved for production App Review, if same build is also waiting for external TestFlight review, if that external TestFlight build could get automatically get approved rather than having to wait for a second manual review.

    In our app we have single IAP subscription group with introductory offer (free trial). We see an uptick in people complaining they are charged right away. We suspect it has something to do with family sharing we have enabled just recently.   Two related questions: 1) If one member of the family receives introductory offer, can another member of the family receive one or will he be charged right away? In other words - is it tracked per family or per user basis. 2) If it's one introductory offer per family - there is code tutorial that suggest to parse all transactions in receipt to verify if user has previously used introductory offer. Will family members see transactions done by other members of the family?

    Can a SKAD ad actually have more than one fidelity ? Apple developer documentation suggests that ad networks have to choose one option of either 1. “StoreKit-Rendered Ads - App Store product page, rendered by StoreKit” 2. “View-Through Ads - Custom, provided by ad network” Providing those rendering options works quite differently on the device, so I’m not sure they could happen simultaneously for the same ad impression. I'm referring to this document: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/signing_and_providing_ads|https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/signing_and_providing_ads  This question came up when reviewing oRTB spec, which defines fidelities as an array: "SKAdNetwork API starting from version 2.2 supports multiple ad presentation options specified by the fidelity-type parameter of the SKAdNetwork signature. This holds parameters used to generate the signature that would be different for each fidelity type supported."  https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/openrtb-guide?hl=en|https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/openrtb-guide?hl=en

    I have implemented StoreKit2 in my new app - and I based my implementation largely upon the sample code from WWDC21-10114 “Meet StoreKit2”.    My use case is simpler than the sample code - I have no nonConsumables nor consumables - just autoRenewables.  And honestly, all I want to know is “which productID is the user currently subscribed to.”    Maybe I’m just confused, but there seems to be A LOT of information retrieved in the sample code, but none of it is easily used to answer my question.  I can tell if the user EVER purchased my subscription (but that’s not terribly helpful - it’s like my wife asking me if I’m subscribed to Sports Illustrated - and I reply by saying YES - but in fact that was 20 years ago when I was in college.)  I can tell if the user is ENTITLED to my subscription (but that’s not helpful either - because it lists ALL of the subscriptions within the group and doesn’t single out the one which I’m ACTUALLY paying for in the moment.)  OK, so bottom line I’m just begging for a simple answer to a simple question:  which product ID is my user currently paying for.  Bonus points for also telling me when that subscription expires, and whether or not they’re in a billing retry or grace period.  Maybe the info is in there somewhere, but I’m all over the map with Transactions, RenewalInfo, and it’s ALLLL confused because I’m using Sandbox Testers (my app hasn’t been approved for distribution yet.)  Any help???

    I develop a universal app (for iOS, iPadOS and macOS) with a subscription-based business model. I currently offer a single subscription level (with monthly and annual durations) that unlocks access to all features on all platforms.  Since there are some users that use my app only one platform I'm considering if it wouldn't be better to have two levels of subscriptions: 1) lower priced one unlocking all features only on a single platform (iOS+iPadOS or macOS) and 2) a more expensive subscription providing access to everything on all platforms. Is that kind of setup allowed or do you have any other recommendations?

    Our company has 8 brands, each one catering to specific user groups with different needs.  We would like to have the same underlaying app development for all brands and publish them as different apps in the App Store. With pertinent UI customizations to match each brand, but keeping the same overall UX.  Due to rule "4.3 Spam" from App Store Review Guidelines we are currently forced to have a single app publised in the App Store for all of our bands. And then users needs to choose a brand after install.  This provides a diminished experience for our users because it's important that users can discover our apps by themselves in the App Store. Also, as need to include information for all brands, all users see information that is not relevant to them and can be confusing.  The addition of Custom product pages may alleviate the situaion but is not ideal as it does not really help with discoverability within the App Store.  We are aware of the need to have rule "4.3 Spam" keep the App Store a safe place and to provide the best experience to our users.  But we would also work with Apple to find a way to be able to offer our users the best possible experience by providing them separate published apps in the App Store with different Bundle IDs. And thus providing the best journey for users since even before they install our apps.  Thank you!

It would be really nice to have it such that if an app gets approved for production App Review, if same build is also waiting for external TestFlight review, if that external TestFlight build could get automatically get approved rather than having to wait for a second manual review.

    Greetings! Hi the team!  I have two quick questions and wait for your response: 1, For the account deletion regulation, I found in the news that there's a newly-mentioned API: Sign in with Apple REST API. It takes some time for me to connect to this API but the deadline is so close.  So my question is: What would happen if the version I will be submitting on July 1st doesn't come with this API? (other parts about the account deletion are perfect)  2, My company would like to apply for the enterprise account - that's Apple Developer Enterprise Program. However, I heard the membership enrollment is limited per year, and very hard to successfully join in. Is there any advice and tips that can help me better join the program?  Summer

    Hi all - I’m still a bit confused about the review process for in-app purchases.  My app needs 4 subscriptions (in one subscriptions group) in order to be happy.  I currently have 1 subscription that’s listed as “Waiting for Review” and 3 which are listed as “Ready to Submit”.  Can I go ahead and submit the app binary (with the 3 subscriptions that are ready) and then add the 4th subscription after (:crossed_fingers:) the binary passes app review?

</blockquote>
<p>|U03JELM0ZNV|:
I have similar concerns. In the model I am building, artists who publish assets on our store will be paid according to prices set. A given greeting-card template may include works by several people getting portions of the price. To complicate things further, we have an NFT-like model in that artists get paid <em>again</em> if someone copies and sends a messaging using their work.</p>
<p>I'd figured our internal accounting will be in the <em>digital gold</em> all the way until the actual artist remittances, and have to work out an exchange rate at that point.</p>
<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
When working with consumable in-app purchases, you need to track in your system the amount of points your customer purchased before finishing the transaction. The App Store doesn’t keep track of how many points each purchase entitles the user to, and transactions for consumable products do not show up in the App Receipt or StoreKit 2 transaction APIs after the transaction is finished.</p>
<p>|U03JELM0ZNV|:
Do we have a formal requirement from Apple to make a consumable balance restorable on a new device?
Whilst it would be nice to offer, it's something I'd defer from v1 if possible.</p>
<p>|U03J22N3FM0|:
I would like to know the price of the purchased item when the purchase is successful.
You can find out by product ID and purchase time, but if you sell in multiple countries, you don’t know which country the store is in.
For now, I’m trying to remember the country of the store at the time of purchase, but it’s complicated when considering reinstallation etc.</p>

The first postback can carry the source identifier, fine conversion value OR coarse conversion value and source app ID provided that the privacy thresholds are met.</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
&lt;@U03JFDN0D88&gt;, sorry for pinging you on this one more time, but I want to follow up a bit as it’s one of the most crucial parts of SKAd Network.</p>
<p>&gt; The first postback <em>can</em> carry the source identifier …
To confirm my understanding, is the 2 digits of source identifier (aka Campaign ID) expected to be anyway in the first postback no matter the privacy threshold?</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
The least significant 2 digits of the source identifier (which you can use for tracking anything and not just campaigns)  will be present in the first postback no matter what the privacy level is</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
For a refresher, in the SKAdNetwork session from today, there is an example showing how the source identifier changes depending on the privacy level. This will show you the different situations that can occur.</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
Yeah, got it!
It was super-clear on the part of the privacy levels in the video, the only confusion was about the combination of it with multiple postbacks.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for the clarifications!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J49L9DG9|:
hi Andrew. yes, you can use SK1 and SK2 in the same app</p>
<p>|U03J49L9DG9|:
i'd probably just isolate my StoreKit code and have two branches, one for iOS 15+ that uses SK2, and one for iOS &lt;15 that uses SK1. that way once you do bump the min OS to 15, you can just remove the SK1 branch</p>
<p>|U03J49L9DG9|:
also SK1 and SK2 use the same backing data on our servers, so if a user updates from 14 to 15, your app starts to use SK2, and all their purchases and such should be there in SK2 right away</p>
<p>|U03JELM0ZNV|:
Just to chase that nuance a little further - if someone gets a new device with ios15/16 does that mean they will get a better <em>Restore Purchases</em> experience automatically (because SK2)?
Or is that all on me to write?</p>
<p>|U03J49L9DG9|:
it should be automatic, StoreKit 2 will attempt to get all of the transaction history when your app opens without needing to do a restore or have the user authenticate. you should be able to just use the StoreKit 2 history APIs pretty much right away</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
Yes, subscriptions of different durations with the same level of service should be on the same subscription group level. If you put them on the same level of service, a user can switch between the two different durations as a “Crossgrade”. Check out this link for more information on subscription levels: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/#ranking">https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/#ranking</a></p>

<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
It’s certainly allowed to add in-app purchases to an existing free app. Check out the StoreKit 2 APIs for in-app purchases to get started: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/in-app_purchase</a></p>
<p>When transitioning to subscriptions, you can use the new <code>AppTransaction</code> API in iOS 16 to reward existing users by checking the <code>originalAppVersion</code> which they downloaded your app.</p>
<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
You can learn more about <code>AppTransaction</code> here: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting_business_model_changes_by_using_the_app_transaction?language=objc">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting_business_model_changes_by_using_the_app_transaction?language=objc</a></p>

We see an uptick in people complaining they are charged right away. We suspect it has something to do with family sharing we have enabled just recently.   Two related questions: 1) If one member of the family receives introductory offer, can another member of the family receive one or will he be charged right away? In other words - is it tracked per family or per user basis. 2) If it's one introductory offer per family - there is code tutorial that suggest to parse all transactions in receipt to verify if user has previously used introductory offer.

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J49S9NL9|:
&gt; 1. "Family Sharing allows a user to share access to auto-renewable subscriptions or non-consumables with up to five family members on all of their Apple devices.  Developers can choose to turn on Family Sharing for in-app purchases and non-consumables in App Store Connect. Users can also choose whether to share their purchases with family." If one family member buys an in-app purchase and family sharing is enabled for that purchase by the purchaser, then all family members will receive access to that purchase.
&gt; 2. When users share a purchase through Family Sharing, each family member gets their own unique receipts and transactions.

<p>|U03JL18FUHH|:
Thank you for the answer. To clarify the #1. Imagine the scenario:
1. Member A starts a free trial (family sharing enabled)
2. Member A cancels the subscription before the trial ends
3. Member B tries to start the trial for the same product 2 months later
I know that member A would be charged right away, what about member B? Will he/she have their own trial or will they be charged right away as other family member has already used an introductory offer.</p>
<p>|U03J49S9XHP|:
In this scenario, the answer is no – they will not have their own trials.</p>
<p>|U03JL18FUHH|:
Ah thank you for the edit :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03J49S9XHP|:
My apologies, I was responding to the other version of the question,
&gt; Can two members of the same family use an introductory offer for single family-sharable subscription IAP?</p>
<p>|U03JL18FUHH|:
Is there a way to test if someone on the family has used introductory offer before? Basically is there a way to reliably tell if “this user is eligible for introductory offer”? From what I’m reading it seems to be impossible</p>
<p>|U03JL18FUHH|:
Sorry for double posting, I really thought no-one would ever come back to my thread.</p>
<p>|U03J49S9XHP|:
For StoreKit 2, there is the property <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/3803203-iseligibleforintrooffer">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/3803203-iseligibleforintrooffer</a> that you can use to determine if a user is eligible for an introductory offer.</p>

Switching from a paid to freemium model is supported in StoreKit 2 with the AppTransaction API. With the app transaction, you'll want to make use of the <code>originalAppVersion</code> (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/apptransaction/3954447-originalappversion">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/apptransaction/3954447-originalappversion</a>

Apple developer documentation suggests that ad networks have to choose one option of either 1. “StoreKit-Rendered Ads - App Store product page, rendered by StoreKit” 2. “View-Through Ads - Custom, provided by ad network” Providing those rendering options works quite differently on the device, so I’m not sure they could happen simultaneously for the same ad impression. I'm referring to this document: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/signing_and_providing_ads|https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/signing_and_providing_ads">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/signing_and_providing_ads|https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/signing_and_providing_ads</a>  This question came up when reviewing oRTB spec, which defines fidelities as an array: "SKAdNetwork API starting from version 2.2 supports multiple ad presentation options specified by the fidelity-type parameter of the SKAdNetwork signature. This holds parameters used to generate the signature that would be different for each fidelity type supported."  <a href="https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/openrtb-guide?hl=en|https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/openrtb-guide?hl=en">https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/openrtb-guide?hl=en|https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/openrtb-guide?hl=en</a></h4>

<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
Hello, as the developer documentation calls out, fidelity can be one of two values at the moment
1. Fidelity for "StoreKit Rendered Ads"
2. Fidelity for "View-Through Ads"
Fidelity is very much a singular value and not considered an array.</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
I believe that in the link posted above to the google documentation, when they say "array" they are referring to the array of parameters that compose the signature and not the fidelity specifically</p>

<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
The best way to test how your multiplatform app handles syncing subscriptions across different devices is to use the Sandbox environment or TestFlight. Since StoreKit Testing in Xcode is local to your device, you won’t be able to test syncing purchases across different devices or simulators. If you’re using Xcode, you can simulate how your app behaves if a purchase is made on a different device in your unit tests using the <code>buyProduct(productIdentifier:)</code> method on <code>SKTestSession</code>: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekittest/sktestsession/3579475-buyproductwithidentifier?changes=__3">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekittest/sktestsession/3579475-buyproductwithidentifier?changes=__3</a></p>
<p>You can still test how your app handles purchases made on the device with Xcode in the simulator. If your app can handle things like interrupted purchases and ask to buy in Xcode, you should be good to go for handling off device purchases :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

<p>You just need to set up your scheme like the guide outlines, and then run the app in the simulator.</p>

Hi Brendan - Yes, you can leverage subscription offer feature such as offer code to give user a free year of service.

<p>In addition, if you have implemented user account creation in your app. If you give them the free access by syncing app receipts with user account and giving them free service or leverage <code>AppTransaction</code> released this year. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/apptransaction">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/apptransaction</a></p>
<p>|U03JENQA0TB|:
Thanks. I’ll look into offer codes. Hopefully they can be unique for each customer so they can’t be shared.  Basically thinking that if I can look at the receipt from the old bundle ID app (perhaps copied into the app group container), then I could give them the special offer when they launch the new version. “I see you have the old version of the app. Here’s a free year subscription to the new version!”</p>
<p>There are no user accounts in my app. All the data is stored locally on their devices and synced to their own iCloud accounts. No server to login to.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
Hello Petr, do you mean so that you can dedupe among the same user installing - deleting -  reinstalling - deleting and so on?</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
&lt;@U03JFDN0D88&gt;, no, the thinking is to be able to count install only once for every possible of combinations in case of multiple conversions sent through the newly introduced scheme of multiple conversions.</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
E.g., in a stream of events like
• Install 1, postback 1
• Install 1, postback 2
• Install 2, postback 1
• Install 3, postback 2 <em>(I am not sure if that’s possible)</em>
To be able to identify that there was exactly 3 different installations</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
Understood. No, any deduplication of these would have to be done using logic on your end after you receive the postbacks.</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
Yeah, I mean will there be some fields in a postback to do that?
E.g. to tie them with one install? Or to identify was it 1st, 2nd or 3rd one?</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
Depending on the privacy level of the install, different levels of data will be included in the postback. Some combination of those could potentially be used to de-dupe but that would once again be up to your implementation when you receive the postbacks.</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
Got it!
It looks a bit worrying to me because in that case I effectively can’t see a way for an example above we won’t be able to calculate the count of distinct installs and therefore all other crucial for advertisers metrics (CPI &amp; conversion rate).</p>
<p>However, thanks a lot for answering, I hope to have more clarity when more documentation will be revealed :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
One more thing, Install 3, postback 1 will be the first postback from Install 3
Install 3, postback 2 cannot be sent without Install 3, postback 1 being sent before.</p>
<p>Just so you know.</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
Yeah, that helps a lot also, thank you!</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
You are very welcome! :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
Will there be a way to understand which postback is it?</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
Like 1st/2nd or 3rd?</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
the postback will have a new field identifying which sequence index it is</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:

My use case is simpler than the sample code - I have no nonConsumables nor consumables - just autoRenewables.  And honestly, all I want to know is “which productID is the user currently subscribed to.”    Maybe I’m just confused, but there seems to be A LOT of information retrieved in the sample code, but none of it is easily used to answer my question.  I can tell if the user EVER purchased my subscription (but that’s not terribly helpful - it’s like my wife asking me if I’m subscribed to Sports Illustrated - and I reply by saying YES - but in fact that was 20 years ago when I was in college.)  I can tell if the user is ENTITLED to my subscription (but that’s not helpful either - because it lists ALL of the subscriptions within the group and doesn’t single out the one which I’m ACTUALLY paying for in the moment.)  OK, so bottom line I’m just begging for a simple answer to a simple question:  which product ID is my user currently paying for.  Bonus points for also telling me when that subscription expires, and whether or not they’re in a billing retry or grace period.  Maybe the info is in there somewhere, but I’m all over the map with Transactions, RenewalInfo, and it’s ALLLL confused because I’m using Sandbox Testers (my app hasn’t been approved for distribution yet.)  Any help???</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
Use the <code>Product.SubscriptionInfo.status(for:)</code> method to get information about a subscription. This array may have multiple items in it if your subscription supports family sharing, and multiple family members are subscribed to the subscription group. You can iterate the array and give the user access to the highest level of service they are entitled to in the family.</p>
<p>From there, the <code>Product.SubscriptionInfo.Status</code> value gives you access to a <code>Transaction</code> value and a <code>Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo</code> value.</p>
<p>On the <code>Transaction</code> value check the <code>productID</code> property to get the product identifier of the most recent subscription the customer paid for within the subscription group. To get the group ID check the <code>groupID</code> property. You can check when the transaction expires using the <code>expirationDate</code> property, keep in mind this date may be in the past.</p>
<p>On the <code>Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo</code> value you can check the <code>currentProductID</code> to get the same information as <code>productID</code> on the <code>Transaction</code> value. The renewal info value also allows you to check if the user changed their renewal preference such that the subscription will renew to a different subscription, or cancel at the end of the current period using the <code>autoRenewPreference</code> property.</p>
<p>Let me know if you need any additional clarifications :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
In the sample app you mentioned, take a look at the <code>SubscriptionStatusView</code> and <code>updateSubscriptionStatus</code> method to see how this works in practice.</p>

<p>|U03J201SFAP|:
Thanks, Greg.  I have followed the sample app pretty faithfully - and a LOT of my confusion is related to the behavior of Sandbox testers.  I am hesitant to release a product where I can’t fully test and comprehend the results I’m getting - and the sandbox appears to be somewhat opaque.</p>
<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
If you have any specific questions about testing with Sandbox this is a good place to ask them :slightly_smiling_face:
You also have the Xcode environment available to you for testing which gives you a lot more control over the server for more robust testing.</p>
<p>|U03J201SFAP|:
I’ve seen Apple state several times between WWDC21 and this year too - that StoreKit2 is designed to make it really easy to get the info you need.  I also understand that there are a lot of edge cases (like FamilySharing) that require consideration.  But, please hear me:  it sure feels like there’s a LOT of work involved to just answer the basic question of “do I give my user access to this autoRenewable product ID or not?”  If it’s a ‘no’, then yay - there are lots of APIs I can use to investigate further.  But what I’d really love is just a func that returns a Bool.</p>
<p>|U03J201SFAP|:
And - regarding the use of Xcode to test - I’m glad to hear that you consider that more robust than the sandbox.  To be honest, I didn’t spend much time there because I had assumed that this was really an Apple-server to my-app issue.  I’ll do a deep dive into that.  Thanks.  :pray: </p>
<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
As you said, there’s a lot of edge cases that require consideration, so it’s really difficult for us to create a one size fits all function that returns a <code>Bool</code>. That said, we appreciate your feedback and it would be very helpful for us if you submitted any enhancement requests or feedback via Feedback Assistant to help us track your feedback :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>If a function like <code>func shouldGiveAccess(productID: String) -&amp;gt; Bool</code> would be useful for your app, you could totally implement something like that using your own business rules on top of the StoreKit API. Every different app might implement that function differently, so it’s best for you to create one that fits your needs perfectly. We’re happy to help guide you through the process of building that on top of the existing APIs on the developer forums if you run into any issues, you can write to us there any time of the year, not just during WWDC :grinning:</p>
<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
I’ll also add that each different testing environment is suited for different needs. Xcode is great for repeating tests over and over both manually and in unit tests, and for simulating scenarios that are only possible when you have full control of the server environment. Sandbox is great for testing server APIs, and how your app will work when you don’t have as much control over the environment. I’d also recommend checking out TestFlight so you can test how your app works with different users. For the best experience for your users we recommend you use Xcode to help when developing new features, write unit tests against your IAP integrations using Xcode, test against Sandbox when your app is getting ready for release, test your server integrations against Sandbox if applicable, put your app on TestFlight for testing with a wider audience, and finally release your app on the store.</p>
<p>|U03J201SFAP|:
Understood.  Thanks for that clarification.  With respect to the func -&gt; Bool - I did implement that using Product.SubscriptionInfo.status(for:), Product.SubscriptionInfo.RenewalInfo and Transactions.  There’s a lot of code in that little func that returns a Bool.  My concern is that it’s a lot of code, and the Sandbox returns such seemingly nonsensical results.  </p>
<p>Results like I have 2 sandbox phones with one common Sandbox tester id.  One shows subscription1 is current, the other shows subscription2 is current - but I’ve heard stated that StoreKit keeps each user’s devices in sync.  </p>
<p>I also got results where Product.SubscriptionInfo.Status == .inBillingRetryPeriod but the Transaction.latest(for:) .expirationDate is 36 hours old - when the AppStoreConnect Sandbox tester's Renewal Rate is 5 minutes.  </p>
<p>I really don’t mean to complain - I’m just saying that there’s a LOT of code to answer a simple question, and I’m at a loss for how to test this to the highest standards.  </p>
<p>I’d really love to see a series of Apple approved articles which offer definitive configurations &amp; testing steps for the most common use cases.</p>
<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
Thank you for the feedback. If you’re running into unexpected behavior in any environment, please file bugs using Feedback Assistant and we’ll take a look at how we can get you back on track. If you find the transaction data appears out of date between two devices, try calling <code>AppStore.sync()</code> to reconcile things.</p>

You can certainly offer two tiers of subscription service at different prices, with the lower tier offering support for iOS devices, and the higher tier offering support for both iOS and macOS.  See here for more information on ranking subscriptions:

Excellent! Thanks!</p>

<p>|U03J49L9DG9|:
yes</p>
<p>|U03HRLNQ5JN|:
Yes, assuming you rank your subscriptions logically, that would be an Upgrade:
&gt; Upgrade. Someone purchases a subscription that offers a higher level of service than their current subscription. They’re immediately upgraded and receive a refund of the prorated amount of their original subscription. If you’d like people to immediately access more content or features, rank the subscription higher to make it an upgrade.</p>
<p>|U03HRLNQ5JN|:
Sure thing!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03J49LAG3B|:
Make sure your basic and advanced subscriptions are in the same subscription group, and then configure the subscription levels corresponding to the level of service offered for each option. In this case, you would want your Advanced subscription to be tier 1, and your Basic subscription to be tier 2. In this case, if a user is currently subscribed to Basic and then subscribes to Advanced, their subscription to Advanced will begin immediately. If they were already paying for Basic they’ll receive a partial refund for the remainder of the Basic subscription period. This only works if you set Advanced to a higher level of service than Basic, so that the change would be considered an upgrade</p>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HFAWFQ13|:
Hi James!
When submitting a subscription for the first time the subscription(s) need to be submitted with a version. If there are multiple subscriptions related to that version, all of them should be submitted together with the app version. Once you have one or more subscriptions approved for your app, additional subscriptions can be submitted at a later time, with or without a version submission.</p>
<p>If you have additional questions about your review submission, there is also an App Store Review lab happening tomorrow and Friday that you can sign up for in the Developer app.</p>
<p>|U03J201SFAP|:
Hi Shannon…</p>
<p>Thank you so much for clearing that up for me. </p>
<p>My lack of understanding on this point has gotten me into a pickle…. Now that one of my subscriptions was rejected (ie, marked as “Developer Action Needed”) - it is no longer available in the Big Blue “Select In-App Purchases or Subscriptions” button in App Store Connect.  Chicken or egg, redux.  I’m guessing that my best (or only) path forward is now to ask the App Review group to clear the subscription rejection so that I can re-submit my app binary — or is there something that the AppStoreConnect folks can do to clear it out?</p>
<p>|U03HFAWFQ13|:
Hey James. If you make any edit to your subscription and click save, the subscription should then show up in the list to submit again.</p>
<p>|U03J201SFAP|:
Hey - THAT WORKED!!!  :smiley:  I just had to add a space character to the end of the English localization description.  Thanks, Shannon!</p>

As an extreme example, if API will be called every hour, is it correct to expect all 3 postbacks somewhere after the end of respective periods (2nd day, 7th day, 35th day)? If will be called somewhere after the install and then only after 7+ days, so missing the timeframe for the 2nd postback, but matching for the 1st and 3rd ones, what would be sent? Only the 1st, or all 3 of them?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
Hello Petr,</p>
<p>A postback will only be sent if at least one update call was received during it's specific time window.</p>
<p>So, your extreme example is correct.</p>
<p>If you call after the install, and then after 7+ days, the first postback and third postback will be sent. The second one won't.</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
So to follow up a bit on the last case. You’ve <a href="https://wwdc22.slack.com/archives/C03H49L2CA1/p1654722678272989?thread_ts=1654722064.393819&amp;cid=C03H49L2CA1|mentioned earlier">https://wwdc22.slack.com/archives/C03H49L2CA1/p1654722678272989?thread_ts=1654722064.393819&amp;cid=C03H49L2CA1|mentioned earlier</a> that the situation when 1st and 3rd postbacks are sent, but the 2nd is not should not be possible.</p>
<p>Could you please clarify in terms of this case?</p>
<p>I am mostly concerned even not about this exact case but more about the scenario when the 1st one wasn’t triggered, but only 2nd/3rd were triggered and sent.
I am worried about this case because it’s crucial to always have the 1st postback as it seems to be the only way to calculate a correct number of installations.</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
Understood.</p>
<p>When you make the first update API call, it will update the first postback thereby guaranteeing that it will be sent.</p>
<p>After that, it depends on when you call update. If you miss a postback's time window, it will not be sent.</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
Oh, sorry, probably I misunderstood that message that I am referring to.
So does it mean that situation of having <em>1st+3rd</em> postbacks without the <em>2nd</em> is possible, but the sitatution of having, <em>2nd or 3rd</em> postback without the <em>1st</em> is impossible?</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
In other words, as long as you call register/update after install, the first postback will be sent.</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
Exactly what you said.</p>
<p>|U03JSTT4C10|:
So is it correct that all the conversion windows (0-2 days, 3-7 days, and 8-35 days) are counted not from the moment of installation but from the moment of calling the register/update for the first time?</p>
<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
That is correct.</p>

<p>|U03JH7N0KSS|:
Hi Susannah - Non-subscription apps may offer a free time-based trial period before presenting a full unlock option by setting up a Non-Consumable IAP item at Price Tier 0 that follows the naming convention: “XX-day Trial.” Prior to the start of the trial, your app must clearly identify its duration, the content or services that will no longer be accessible when the trial ends, and any downstream charges the user would need to pay for full functionality. Learn more about managing content access and the duration of the trial period using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/choosing_a_receipt_validation_technique|Receipts">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original_api_for_in-app_purchase/choosing_a_receipt_validation_technique|Receipts</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck|Device Check">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck|Device Check</a>.</p>

Hello! For that view specifically in the SKDemo app, the <code>updateSubscriptionStatus()</code> method can already tell that the subscription is not revoked since it's checking the status state and it skips over the <code>.revoked</code> statuses.</p>

<p>|U03JFDN0D88|:
Hello Eran,</p>
<p>SKAdNetwork has some defenses against being flooded with view-through ads. One such defense is the minimum 2 second display requirement as documented at: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/3727303-endimpression">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork/3727303-endimpression</a></p>
<p>|U03JTHGQNL9|:
Does iOS/SKAdNetwork has a way to validate there's something being displayed on the screen?</p>
<p>Otherwise, SDKs in various apps could simply call startImpression and endImpression with enough delay (2+ seconds) to make it seem like an impression took place.</p>
<p>We're asking since these are challenges customers are facing today with SKAN, and given the blackbox nature, it's up to the OS to secure these (some sort of attestation, although being hard since you can't control every ad view controller .. yet?)</p>

Hey Jeff. Thanks for the links. They do describe the technical - and a quick review of the transcripts (OMG I LOVE THOSE!!!!) suggests that my one cool function is a great fit for an App Clip.</p>
<p>Is there anyone here who can comment on how to best market these?  Print ads, posters, etc make sense - but what about stuff outside of the normal?  What are some of the most successful ways you’ve seen these promoted?</p>

Hi Sam, we don't comment on future plans, but appreciate your feedback. You're correct - Product Page Optimization is a feature for apps in the iOS and iPadOS App Store, and the types of metadata that can be tested include: app icon, screenshot, and preview video. In addition to other metadata like keywords and description, and data filters for device and source type, what would be the most meaningful improvements to the feature for your app?</p>
<p>|U03K8FBMZ7B|:
Hey &lt;@U03HWT7MTLZ&gt;, thx for your nice reply. In addition to the improvements I mentioned above, we‘d also love to see the option for even more granular analytics. Which store search keywords led to conversion improvements for specific treatments, and also being able to analyze further by region (not just by store language)? This would significantly improve optimizations for Custom Product Pages, as we could try out more alternatives at once.</p>
<p>First time downloads vs. redownloads, and all the other filters available in other views of App Analytics would be very useful to be able to dive deeper into understanding the impact of different treatments. Right now it's basically a „ok, conversion for this has improved“, without being able to better understand what caused those improvements (and across which user segments).</p>
<p>Product Page Optimization is an amazing tool, however using it currently still feels like a 1.0 version. Adding the aforementioned metrics within ASC would give us a much better understanding of our user intents</p>

Hi &lt;@U03JEKM4LFK&gt;! Another tip: Make sure to create these tiers within the same subscription group in App Store Connect to ensure customers have the ability to upgrade, downgrade or cross-grade between them. Note that if you choose to offer multiple tiers, each one will need to provide ongoing value and a continually innovated experience. For more information please see App Review guideline 3.1.2(a) for more information about creating a great subscription experience - subscriptions must be available across all of a user’s devices.

&lt;@U03J49S9XHP&gt; This session is awesome! I haven't watched it all yet, but I'm having trouble finding the documentation referred to at this timestamp (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10040/?time=893">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10040/?time=893</a>) "Please refer to the App Store developer documentation for complete instructions on verifying an x5c certificate chain using OpenSSL." Can you point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>|U03J1UX2CQK|:
(PS in case you're the same Gabriel T who's presenting that video: thank you for such an in-depth session!! This will help me so much in adopting StoreKit 2 &amp; improving our app's subscription performance by skipping the external HTTP call)</p>
<p>|U03HJ8HUYQJ|:
Hi William — it is the same Gabriel :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>|U03HJ8HUYQJ|:
Also –– we will check on that documentation URL getting linked to Gabriel’s WWDC22 session. Please check this session’s page in the Developer app again in the future. :raised_hands:</p>
<p>|U03J1UX2CQK|:
Wonderful! Thank you for being so helpful!</p>
<p>|U03J49S9XHP|:
&lt;@U03J1UX2CQK&gt; I'm so happy to hear that! If you have any additional feedback on anything that might be helpful, please file a Feedback ticket and let me know</p>
<p>|U03J1UX2CQK|:
StoreKit2 is seriously everything I was wishing for in all my years with <code>/verifyReceipt</code>. I only wish I could go back and use StoreKit2 when I first developed for StoreKit subscriptions back in 2018.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03J49S9XHP&gt; My big piece of feedback would be that sample code with popular server-side languages and/or server-side Swift would be greatly appreciated. Here's my feedback on that from earlier this year: FB9842697. Your session (and maybe that documentation, once I find it) definitely close much of the gap, but I think actual demo implementations would be helpful.</p>
<p>And since I've got you here, might as well be greedy with my suggestions: server-side libraries for interacting with the App Store server APIs &amp; decoding JWS, etc. would be super cool (FB10161931).</p>
<p>|U03HJ8HUYQJ|:
Hi William — we appreciate your feedback and thank you for sending those 2 FB numbers! :raised_hands:</p>
<p>|U03J49S9XHP|:
Thank you so much for the feedback, William! I am also quite happy to hear that.</p>

Most of the features in StoreKit Testing in Xcode are supported on Apple Watch on real devices and the simulator. Of course features that are normally not available on watchOS, like the refund request or offer codes APIs, are not supported for testing on watchOS.</p>
<p>|U03JMMN8659|:

Offer code redemption is not supported in sandbox, please submit feedback using Feedback Assistant for any enhancement requests.</p>
<p>Testing offer codes is available in StoreKit Testing in Xcode though, and with the new App Store Connect syncing feature, it even syncs offer codes set up in App Store Connect to a StoreKit configuration file! Check out this year's WWDC session to see it in action:

Customers are eligible for a promotional offer only if they are a current or previous subscriber.

We would like to have the same underlaying app development for all brands and publish them as different apps in the App Store. With pertinent UI customizations to match each brand, but keeping the same overall UX.  Due to rule "4.3 Spam" from App Store Review Guidelines we are currently forced to have a single app publised in the App Store for all of our bands. And then users needs to choose a brand after install.  This provides a diminished experience for our users because it's important that users can discover our apps by themselves in the App Store. Also, as need to include information for all brands, all users see information that is not relevant to them and can be confusing.  The addition of Custom product pages may alleviate the situaion but is not ideal as it does not really help with discoverability within the App Store.  We are aware of the need to have rule "4.3 Spam" keep the App Store a safe place and to provide the best experience to our users.  But we would also work with Apple to find a way to be able to offer our users the best possible experience by providing them separate published apps in the App Store with different Bundle IDs. And thus providing the best journey for users since even before they install our apps.  Thank you!</h4>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03HU1RS59S|:
StoreKit 2 is designed to work well alongside the original StoreKit API so your app can use features of StoreKit 2 while keeping your previously-built system in place.</p>
<p>|U03HZ2VBE21|:
How does that work if listening to transactions at the same time? Who gets notified of a new payment first? If I call 'finishTransaction' on legacy StoreKit, does that affect the StoreKit2 observer?</p>

Calling <code>finishTransaction</code> on the original StoreKit API will not affect the StoreKit 2 Transaction listener.</p>

I'd also like to know if pluralization works in non-English languages, too. E.g. in German, pluralization is not as easy as appending an "s", so pluralization rules/dictionaries are needed. The pages mention only that pluralization works, but don't talk about foreign languages at all.</p>

However, app review is typically "slow" (~24 hours) for external TestFlight testers. Besides the fact that it would be nice if external TestFlight review was as fast as regular App Review, one issue is when we have a critical bug, we are able to get an update out to production users quickly (even without needing an expedited review), but it can take ~24 hours for the same update to make it to external TestFlight testers due to the longer review process. It would be really nice to have it such that if an app gets approved for production App Review, if same build is also waiting for external TestFlight review, if that external TestFlight build could get automatically get approved rather than having to wait for a second manual review.</h4>

</blockquote>
<p>|U03H3LTMBL7|:
Hi Roman, the best way to highlight subscription plans on the App Store listing is to use Promoted In-App Purchases. You can have up to 20 Promoted In-App Purchases at a time, each of which would have an image.</p>
<p>Have a look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/promoting-in-app-purchases/|this page">https://developer.apple.com/app-store/promoting-in-app-purchases/|this page</a> for more information about Promoted In-App Purchases, and <a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/deve3105860f|this page">https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/deve3105860f|this page</a> for direction on setting them up in App Store Connect.</p>
<p>|U03JER2C7MX|:
&lt;@U03H3LTMBL7&gt; Yeah, I was wondering if I could make different versions of these purchases, using a different image, title, and description, and compare which one of them performs better, just like it is possible to do with the product page.</p>
<p>|U03H3LTMBL7|:
Hi Roman – thanks for the additional context.</p>
<p>In-App Purchases with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/product-page-optimization/|Product Page Optimization">https://developer.apple.com/app-store/product-page-optimization/|Product Page Optimization</a> isn’t something supported today, but we encourage the feedback and would love to hear your use case.</p>

Hi the team!  I have two quick questions and wait for your response: 1, For the account deletion regulation, I found in the news that there's a newly-mentioned API: Sign in with Apple REST API. It takes some time for me to connect to this API but the deadline is so close.  So my question is: What would happen if the version I will be submitting on July 1st doesn't come with this API? (other parts about the account deletion are perfect)  2, My company would like to apply for the enterprise account - that's Apple Developer Enterprise Program. However, I heard the membership enrollment is limited per year, and very hard to successfully join in. Is there any advice and tips that can help me better join the program?  Summer</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>|U03H3LT7YSK|:
Hi Summer! Thank you for the questions.</p>
<p>Regarding #1:
Apps that support account creation are required to let users initiate deletion of their account starting June 30, 2022, as described in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1v|App Store Review Guideline 5.1.1(v)">https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1v|App Store Review Guideline 5.1.1(v)</a>.</p>
<p>Also, please keep <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12m75xbj|these requirements">https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12m75xbj|these requirements</a> in mind when submitting app updates to your app after June 30th:
• The account deletion option should be easy to find in your app.
• If your app offers Sign in with Apple, you’ll need to use the Sign in with Apple REST API to revoke user tokens when deleting an account.
• It’s insufficient to only provide the ability to temporarily disable or deactivate an account. People should be able to delete the account along with their personal data.
• Apps in highly-regulated industries may provide additional customer service flows to confirm and facilitate the account deletion process.
• Follow applicable legal requirements for storing and retaining user account information, and for handling account deletion. This includes complying with local laws in different countries or regions. As always, check with your legal counsel.
Regarding #2:
Please review this overview of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/|Apple Developer Enterprise Program">https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/|Apple Developer Enterprise Program</a>. Here you will find eligibly requirements for signing up for this program.</p>

Hi Hugo. I would suggest responding to your app review rejection message in the App Review section of your app in App Store Connect to discuss any confusion with your app submission.</p>

Hi James,</p>
<p>This sounds like a scenario that might be best discussed directly with App Review so that you can ensure all items get submitted and approved correctly.</p>
<p>Since labs and lounges are finishing up, I encourage you to contact App Review using this page: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/">https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/</a></p>
