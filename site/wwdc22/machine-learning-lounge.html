    How would you recommend to approach the classification of various fine-grained subclasses of the same class? Specifically talking about different types of something made of paper.  For example: "a postcard with something written on it", vs "an empty postcard" vs "just some piece of paper" vs "another object"?  With classifier model we were able to obtain very accurate results to distinguish "paper vs some other object". However we couldn't get accurate enough results (I think ~60% accuracy) regarding the more fine-grained decisions: "postcard vs some piece of paper" and "postcard with text vs empty postcard". The mistakes were usually into false-positive side (identifying some piece of paper as a postcard in my example).   So how would you setup the training samples for this sort of goal? Or are we looking in the wrong option, and should be considering some other method, or a combination of methods instead?  Thanks.

    Im part of a team that is building an app that is wishing to identify and recognise faces in a collection of photos.

For example: "a postcard with something written on it", vs "an empty postcard" vs "just some piece of paper" vs "another object"?  With classifier model we were able to obtain very accurate results to distinguish "paper vs some other object". However we couldn't get accurate enough results (I think ~60% accuracy) regarding the more fine-grained decisions: "postcard vs some piece of paper" and "postcard with text vs empty postcard". The mistakes were usually into false-positive side (identifying some piece of paper as a postcard in my example).   So how would you setup the training samples for this sort of goal? Or are we looking in the wrong option, and should be considering some other method, or a combination of methods instead?  Thanks.

<p>Yes</p>
<p>If you have multiple people in the screen. Try to keep other people consistently smaller than the main person. Then it will still work (automatically select the maximum bounding box person)</p>

<p>&gt; When it comes to using the model in your applications, make sure to only select a single person. Your app may remind users to keep only one person in view when multiple people are detected, or you can implement your own selection logic to choose a person based on their size or location within the frame, and this can be achieved by using the coordinates from pose landmarks.</p>

I am interested in the ability to extract text from images and video.  The Vision framework does a great job of extracting the text.  One thing I would like to do is determine whether each piece of text is in a particular category of typeface, largely looking to tell a source code / monospace font from a sans serif font.  Which machine learning technologies available on Apple platforms would be best suited for that? And a high level of how you might approach that?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Vision framework, where you extract the text, tells you the region in the image where the text is; the first thing to do would be to crop the text out of the image.</p>
<p>If you have a binary image classifier (sans serif vs serif, or “looks like source code” vs “doesn’t look like source code”, it’s worth experimenting with what definition works best – and you’d need to collect samples of each for your training set!), you can then throw that crop to this classifier to work out whether it’s source code or not.</p>
<p>So at a high level, what I’d do is;</p>
<p>• train a binary classifier to distinguish source-code from not-source-code
• using Vision, crop out the region of the image with detected text in
• use your classifier to determine whether it’s source code or not
and go from there!</p>
<p>Also you can try out the Live Text API this year, it's able to extract text of out images and videos. However it does not provide font-related information of the text yet. You can file a bug tracking this issue to us if needed.</p>

Is prediction window size a factor?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The window size is fixed once a model is trained. At prediction time, you may adjust something called <code>stride</code> , i.e., how often (in terms of number of frames) you create a new prediction window. The smaller the <code>stride</code> , the faster you make a next prediction. This can make the results to refresh faster</p>
<p>There was a sample code from last year, called “<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiThdeDl5z4AhUpiI4IHYOUAAcQFnoECAgQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Fdocumentation%2Fcreateml%2Fdetecting_human_actions_in_a_live_video_feed&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ufSKqW6Qz_al-8HXVsvWK|Detecting Human Actions in a Live Video Feed">https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiThdeDl5z4AhUpiI4IHYOUAAcQFnoECAgQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Fdocumentation%2Fcreateml%2Fdetecting_human_actions_in_a_live_video_feed&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ufSKqW6Qz_al-8HXVsvWK|Detecting Human Actions in a Live Video Feed</a>”, you may check this as a reference</p>
<p>Your app - and the model - need to balance three concerns:  Accuracy, Latency, and CPU Usage.</p>
<p>• :window: A shorter window size (selected at training time) may reduce run-time latency!  But if the window is shorter than the longest event you are trying to recognise, then accuracy may be reduced
• :man-walking:A shorter stride can also reduce latency, but results in more frequent calls to the model, which can increase energy use.
• :kangaroo: A longer stride reduces CPU usage, and allows other functions in your app such as drawing functions more time to work - which might help reduce any performance related bugs in your app, but will increase latency.</p>
<p>Also, try not to skip frames (unless you did the same for your training data), otherwise, the effective action speed captured in the window will change, and this may mess up the prediction result (accuracy)</p>
<p><em>Latency</em>: is the time between when the action happens in the real world to when the app detects it and tells the user.  This will be experienced as 'snappiness'.  For action classifications, latency is at least as long as the windows size, plus a bit.  It's an emergent parameter caused by other choices you make.</p>
<p><em>Stride</em>: is the time the model waits in between two detections.  This can be shorter OR longer than the window length.  It's a parameter used in the inference pipeline in your app.</p>
<p>Good summary :+1:. Latency can be slightly shorter than the window size, cause the model can predict the action when it sees the partial action. That’s why a shorter stride can help to refresh the results faster</p>
<p>You may also be able to reduce energy, memory and CPU usage by setting the camera to a lower resolution.  If your app is very busy, making this change might improve app performance.</p>
<p>This change should not reduce model accuracy, but your user's view of the scene will not be so sharp.</p>
<p>Another inference speed factor might be your device. A newer device with neural engine will help. A fully charged device, and operating in good lighting condition, etc. can also help to reduce the latency (improve the Vision pose detection speed, and camera frame rate)</p>
<p>We have a great session on understanding the performance of apps with machine learning models this year!  Check it out:</p>

Specifically talking about different types of something made of paper.  For example: "a postcard with something written on it", vs "an empty postcard" vs "just some piece of paper" vs "another object"?  With classifier model we were able to obtain very accurate results to distinguish "paper vs some other object". However we couldn't get accurate enough results (I think ~60% accuracy) regarding the more fine-grained decisions: "postcard vs some piece of paper" and "postcard with text vs empty postcard". The mistakes were usually into false-positive side (identifying some piece of paper as a postcard in my example).   So how would you setup the training samples for this sort of goal? Or are we looking in the wrong option, and should be considering some other method, or a combination of methods instead?  Thanks.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you using Create ML for this or a different training framework?</p>
<p>Currently had to settle on Vision (rectangle + text detection), but would prefer Create ML solution (if I can find a proper training for it - hence this question)</p>
<p>Something you could try is doing a hierarchical approach where you first detect the overall class and then crop and do a more precise classification.</p>
<p>Thanks. Do you think classification is feasible at all in this case? Or I should really concentrate on trying to get the text in such case, rather than trying to classify an object?</p>
<p>In addition to tuning the training, you can also tune the data you're training on like you mention. Adding more examples (width breadth to encompass you expect to see in practice) where you're getting the false positives might help iron out those edge cases. There's some data augmentation options in both the CreateML App and CreateML Components to that could help grow your sample size and add some diversity to it without collecting monumentally more data.</p>
<p>Hard to say if it's feasible. But getting text definitely sounds better suited if your sub-classes are always text based.</p>

<p>&lt;@U03J9R7MVJ7&gt; I'm curious to hear what kinds of features you are wanting to build. Choosing the right task and understanding the data needs for training are a great place to start.</p>
<p>Also, are you looking at off-line training (then deploy) OR on-device training (training on iOS) as the potential use cases?</p>
<p>I would like to build an app to predict stock price trends and classify expenses in a bookkeeping / tax management app</p>
<p>So for something like that, you might look into Tabular Regressors for predicting future prices based on past price data (and whatever other data you want to use), and Tabular Classifiers to classify expenses into categories you select.</p>
<p>And would you use offline training for that?</p>
<p>yes, like &lt;@U03HB4V9Q5V&gt; suggested, this falls into offline-training (then deploy) use case</p>
<p>Here are some videos that can help you start from scratch. As others suggested there are a lot more things added to  Create ML in the last couple years.
* Introducing Create ML - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/703/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/703/</a>
* Introducing the Create ML App - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/430/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/430/</a></p>
<p>In this video there’s a nice example project that you can follow through:
* Build an Action Classifier with Create ML - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10043/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10043/</a></p>
<p>Can you tell me more about the "classify expenses in a bookkeeping / tax management app" case?  What does an example input look like?</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you for your hard work developing all these amazing technologies and providing this support! :clap::clap:</p>
<p>I am not that far yet but I was thinking of a combination of a text and other associated values (business/personal expense) and where the payment is going</p>
<p>is the text likely to be freeform: "A box of chocolates from the candy store on main street", or more like terms: "lunchtime snack"?</p>
<p>More likely to be terms</p>
<p>You might be particularly interested in training on-device using the Create ML framework for this... given the historical data would be highly personal and continually changing (if I'm understanding the use case). The Tabular Regressor example that Alejandro shows in the <em>Get to know Create ML Components</em> session is almost spot on with the problem you're trying to solve.</p>
<p>If the textual input is more varied and similar to human language then you might use a <em>Text Classifier</em>.</p>
<p>If it's more like terms and you want to include additional context such as price (numbers), then the <em>Tabular Regressor</em> is more suitable.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the helpful knowledge!</p>

<p>Create ML does not have a drawing classifier template or task API. You may want to check out the new Create ML Components framework which will let you construct your own pipeline similar to the one used in Turi Create.</p>
<p>Turi Create is still a good option if its working for you</p>
<p>However, Turi Create is no longer under active development</p>
<p>Note: The updatable drawing classifier available on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/">https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/</a> has a pre-trained feature extractor for drawings as the first model in its pipeline.

<p>Really, the limit’s your imagination! But machine learning methods, generally, work well if you have:</p>
<p>• a well-defined objective (in other words, a clear, unambiguous criterion which tells you whether a classification is the right one or how far an estimate is from its true value)
• enough training data.
That’s true of a lot of different problems! Image, audio and text classification are all things which are applicable to a lot of real-world problems – what kind of app are you thinking of building?</p>
<p>Thank you a lot, Andrew! To be honest, I’m just exploring and learning new fields - and I’d like to understand as best as possible CoreML and Create ML to be able to incorporate them in future apps. Nevertheless, Image classification really intrigues me: I think I’ll dive deep into it :smile:</p>
<p>Excellent! Good luck – the key way to take advantate of ML is identifying problems where the <em>goal</em> can be clearly defined but the <em>method</em> is tricky. It’s not worth training a ML model to say whether something is red or blue – the average pixel value tells you that. But determining the class of an object (or reading text out of an image, or…) – these are problems where you can define what a success is unambiguously, but coming up with heuristics for the problem is harder. That’s where you’ll get most “bang for the buck” from ML methods!</p>
<p>Thank you again! That’s an incredible technology - and I’m sure it’ll help me solve challenging problems. Thank you for your precious advices! :smile:</p>

<p>If you already have a GAN model, then you can use it in Create ML Components using an adaptor.</p>
<p>Any Sample Code?</p>
<p>Looking for more of an “Unsharp mask”</p>
<p>Analog for intelligence</p>
<p>Classification models to Generative ones</p>
<p>like compute blur, create Sharp</p>
<p>What is your use case in mind? Do you already have a mlmodel for this?</p>
<p>Building synthetic views of objects that are well represented in the training data.</p>
<p>Like having 1000 hummingbird pictures, being able to create N additional ones</p>
<p>that look real.  Where N is large</p>
<p>Or creating my 3D avitar based on all the images of me in my photo library</p>
<p>Thanks. CreateML Components does not offer out-of-box support for any <em>specific</em> GAN model, but you are able to make a transformer to use a GAN under the hood.</p>
<p>for the GAN model you are interested, do you already have a corresponding mlmodel?</p>
<p>I have a large training set of hummingbird images,…</p>
<p>I’d suggest starting from checking these models (where they are published) that you are interested, see if they can be converted to mlmodels, if you want to perform inference (deploy) on Apple hardware. CreateML or CreateML Components do not offer out-of-box support for such models, it meant to give <em>you</em> the flexibility to do so.</p>

Any tips or pointers on making an image recognition app with live video capture using SwiftUI as a starting point ?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>You have a couple choices here.</p>
<p>You can use the techniques you already know, and use <code>UIViewRepresentable</code>  to import the UIViews into your app.  That will still work really well!</p>
<p>I've actually done exactly that using <code>UIViewControllerRepresentable</code> in the app I'm working on, and used a modified version of the VisionViewController which I think came from that video's sample code. It works perfectly... the entire app is SwiftUI except for the VisionViewController part.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can display the camera feed by sending the image from each frame into a swiftUI <code>Image</code>.</p>
<p>The new <code>CreateMLComponents</code> feature actually includes a <code>VideoReader.readCamera</code> method which provides an asynchronous stream of image buffers, which is a great way to get started with this approach.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use your existing AVCaptureDevice logic and delegate methods to provide a series of images.</p>
<p>You can see an example of this approach in the rep counting demo app which will be available soon as part of the WWDC session on CreateML this year <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/110332">https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/110332</a></p>
<p>Recently I refactored some UIKit code into SwiftUI and found that the <code>ViewController</code> could be relatively easily transformed into an <code>ObservableObject</code> class, changing <code>@IBOulet</code> s into <code>@Published</code> properties.</p>
<p>Thanks &lt;@U03HB4T0CA3&gt;  and &lt;@U03JBEQUEAJ&gt; . Lots of useful hints for me to try and figure out. I am excited to try working on this again  </p>
<p>I've been experimenting with using <code>AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer</code> too, is that what you used &lt;@U03K7TYHFHN&gt;?</p>
<p>&lt;@U03JBEQUEAJ&gt; if you have a link to the VisionViewController I would appreciate it, I may take a look one day and see how that's put together.</p>
<p>Yes was using the preview layer and showed a rectangle box on the screen when scene stability was reached.</p>
<p>Cool, using a preview layer is likely to be a very CPU / memory efficient way to do it.</p>
<p>I don't yet have a clear picture of the efficiency of using SwiftUI views to run the preview directly in the way I proposed above, so while it can be a lot of fun to do it purely in SwiftUI it may not be the best choice just yet.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HB4T0CA3&gt; Here's a link to the original <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/training_a_create_ml_model_to_classify_flowers|sample code that has the VisionViewController">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/training_a_create_ml_model_to_classify_flowers|sample code that has the VisionViewController</a> (click the download button from that page). Unfortunately I don't have a publicly available version that shows where I've used that with <code>UIViewControllerRepresentable</code>.</p>
<p>In case it helps &lt;@U03K7TYHFHN&gt; though (maybe ignore where the Coordinator is a subclass of my ViewModel as that's probably very specific to my use case :sweat_smile:):</p>
<p>&lt;@U03JBEQUEAJ&gt;Thanks so much for sharing. New to learning SwiftUI and trying to grasp how to use UIViewcontrollerRepresentable correctly. Helps to see how you approached it . I am going to keep trying as feeding in an image from live capture for image recognition is way more magical vs forcing a user to take a single snapshot . Thanks again  </p>

<p>Wow, 100000 classes! That’s a hard problem – in fact, it’s something which would be at the research cutting edge.</p>
<p>Is there any structure to your classes? That might be something you could exploit.</p>
<p>It’s definitely worth having a look at the literature here — these tend to be called “extreme classification tasks”</p>
<p><a href="http://manikvarma.org/pubs/bengio19.pdf">http://manikvarma.org/pubs/bengio19.pdf</a></p>
<p>This is a review which covers some of the problems in this area. However, if you have a natural hierarchy to your labels, you might consider having a hierarchy of classifiers. Let’s say we’re talking about animals; you might have a classifier from “animal” to “bird”, “mammal”, “reptile”, etc etc etc, then from “bird” to bird species</p>
<p>That way each classifier is only predicting among, say, 1000 classes – which is a more tractable problem</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no hierarchy. Each image is completely different but easily recognized (usually). This isn't it exactly... but it would be similar to recognizing famous paintings, but where there are hundreds of thousands of them. I appreciate the feedback and will look over that "extreme classification" info. Thanks :smile:</p>
<p>You may want to check out algorithms behind similar image search, where you calculate an embedding for an image, then find N nearest embedding from the known images, and derive your class/object from them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This seems like a good fit for a standard image classifier. The main step to building an effective model would be to get enough sample data in each color and of each object to get a reasonably well-trained model. You could go about this in 2 ways:
• 2 completely separate models, one for type of object and one for color, and combine the outputs together
• A single model, in which each [color/object] pair is its own class. This could help out with interaction effects (if there are no purple bowling balls you'll never predict one), but it also expands the range of classes which might make the accuracy harder.
For multi-color, One option would just be to consider "multi-color" as its own color. As long as your training data reflects that your model should train accurately to that standard.</p>
<p>Or if you need to identify the color and you can crop to the object or even a relevant sub-section like middle square then you can use CIAreaAverage to get 1x1 image of the average color</p>
<p>Thanks - I was thinking of the first approach.  I’m interested in multi-color but also patterning e.g. plaid, floral etc….  I had read somewhere about using pixel counts by color to determine color rather than ML</p>
<p>yes, that pixel-based approach sounds similar</p>
<p>Yes it turns more into an image processing problem at that point. Core Image provides a variety of filters that are very good for image analysis in the "traditional" space</p>
<p>You could combine it with VNGenerateObjectnessBasedSaliencyImageRequest to get a mask and bounding box of the object</p>

<p>Core ML models can support audio data through MultiArray inputs of audio samples.  Create ML does support audio/sound classification but not tempo estimation.</p>
<p>Doing a quick search online it seems there is some work on models for tempo estimation, many of which could be converted to Core ML</p>
<p>Thanks. I have training data where songs have been corrected to have a perfectly consistent BPM throughout and I have a platform that transforms raw audio data into less granular transient magnitudes across frequency bands. I've tried building tabular regressors with the data in a few different ways but haven't gotten useful results so far.</p>
<p>With a tabular regressor you may want to explore some additional feature engineering steps.</p>
<p>Using more traditional DSP style algorithms</p>
<p>Perhaps windowed autocorrelation</p>
<p>That's exactly what the existing app (Tempi, on the app store) uses now. It works pretty well but I suspect an ML approach could be much better.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So this is a technique from classical statistics, but basically a common approach is to take a raw set of data and normalize it before applying a fit function. You could run data with an exponential distribution through a log transform, for example. One of the risks if you don't is that the leverage from a few points can be very high and skew your model. There's tradeoffs to this approach and many different techniques that can help you find a good model, but data normalization is often a helpful technique.</p>
<p>hmm, so generally for better models aim for data in a linear form with minimal outliers</p>
<p>I think in general it can be helpful in data preparation as one tool that's available to use. But there's an entire field on this and I don't want to oversimplify.</p>

<p>A composite operator may help you convert these operations: <a href="https://coremltools.readme.io/docs/composite-operators">https://coremltools.readme.io/docs/composite-operators</a></p>
<p>In some cases you can also supply a <a href="https://coremltools.readme.io/docs/custom-operators|custom operator ">https://coremltools.readme.io/docs/custom-operators|custom operator </a>but to leverage the full Core ML stack its best to see if you can represent the functionality as a composite op first</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HJ5M01M0&gt;  is there any workaround for <code>torch.stft</code> and <code>torch.istft</code>  ?</p>
<p>Are the FFT operations in the beginning / pre processing stage of the model? If so, then you can accelerate the rest of the model by converting it to CoreML, and implementing the FFT operation using BNNS or Metal.
Would be interested to know more of your use case, so if you can request for a lab session on this topic (mentioning my name), would be happy discuss more.
In any case, submitting a feedback request with your use case would be great.</p>

I know NLP depends on extraordinarily large data sets, but I'm wondering about the utility of training a model on a constructed language with a much smaller data set. The one I have in mind has a very small official dictionary (slightly more than 100 official words), and rather simple grammar rules. Are there resources you would recommend for exploring this specific application of ML, or any pitfalls I might want to keep in mind?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>This depends somewhat on what sort of tasks and models you are interested in. For example, for a classification task, the maxent classifier available through CreateML is not language-dependent. It should be able to take on classification tasks in an artificial language of this sort. Gazetteers are language-independent, so they would still be usable. Our built-in embeddings are language-dependent, so they would not be of use here. If you want to train your own embedding or language model using open-source tools, that probably would still require significant amounts of data, but perhaps not as much as with natural languages. Language modeling techniques have recently been applied with some success to programming languages. If your rules are similar to the syntax rules of programming languages, you might consider using the sorts of parsing tools that are used for them, but that is really a different area than NLP.</p>
<p>I am exploring non-ML tokenizing and parsing as well, because the grammar rules are rather straightforward and the word set is small. The language has recently been given an ISO identifier, but there is little support for it in general. I’ll take a closer look at traditional parsing tools, thank you!</p>

<p>Thanks for asking Derick! It would be helpful to clarify what the "objects" are in this context. If they are objects within image data, you could leverage the CreateML feature extractor to turn it into structured tabular data.</p>

Congratulations on a fine presentation. May I ask if there is some functionality to enable to recognise the direction (arrow) of time in a video?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you! I'm so glad that you enjoyed the session. Can you clarify your problem? You may be able to detect the direction of play in a video without machine learning.</p>
<p>Yes &lt;@U03JFGMTU8G&gt;! It's actually a pretty recent research question but it has high value and I was wondering if you have implemented some kind of relevant functionality. It's not so much about detection the direction of play itself but recognising time itself in a video sequence. For example, suppose you have a video of traffic (or even the gym training data in your nice presentation :slightly_smiling_face: ) and that the flow of time is scrambled sometimes going forward and sometimes in reverse. Can we recognise the flow of time at each time point?</p>
<p>In an actual application, the problem would be simpler: Find the direction of time is some video data (is it as the video plays or the reverse?)</p>
<p>Of course the more symmetric the video motion is the harder will be to tell the difference:
For example, in a video data representing flowing water the direction of time is clearly defined (is there some functionality in Create ML to find it?). But in a video that, let's say zooms in in an Apple Maps windows, playing it in reverse would be equivalent to zooming out, so this anti-symmetry does not allows us to have a clearly defined direction of time.</p>
<p>Interesting problem! You may find understanding the apparent motion of pixels in the image a useful input. You can compute optical flow using Vision <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vngenerateopticalflowrequest|VNGenerateOpticalFlowRequest ">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vngenerateopticalflowrequest|VNGenerateOpticalFlowRequest </a></p>
<p>Hmm thanks &lt;@U03HRMWNP4J&gt;! That is a very useful input indeed! However, one would still have to interpret these motions as representing something going forward in actual time or backwards (like decide if water is flowing forwards, out of a faucet, or backwards, into the faucet). My guess would be entropy estimation/learning would be critical in making such a decision.</p>
<p>As I wrote, it is still a pretty recent research question (for example, this is an ERC grand given last year to further study it in detail
<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/950086">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/950086</a>
) but it has important practical implications that it would be very nice to see any such functionality implemented in Create ML, to be able to working with temporal (agnostic) data.</p>

<p><code>MLImageClassifier.ModelParameters</code> still has the</p>

<p>When I try to only assign the maxIterations, XCode complains that the function is deprecated, is that the expected behavior?</p>
<p>There are a few initializers that were deprecated so if you are trying to use one of those old ones to set the maxIterations, you will get this warning.</p>
<p>However, are you trying to use this exact initializer and still getting a warning?</p>
<p>This is how I am accessing it MLImageClassifier.ModelParameters(maxIterations: 50)</p>
<p>Yeah because the initializer that I am suggesting has no default value for <code>augmentation</code> . So, when you call this initializer you need to pass the <code>augmentation</code> parameter as well. If you don't want to set any <code>augmentation</code>, you can just pass a value of 0 for this parameter.</p>
<p>If you do not specify <code>augmentation</code> in the init at all, one of the old initializers will be used and hence you will get the deprecated warning.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>IOSurface-backed <code>CVPixelBuffer</code> with <code>OneComponent16Half</code> pixel format type can be shared with Neural Engine without copy. Likewise, <code>MLMultiArray</code> which is backed by the pixel buffer can also be shared without copy. (See <code>-[MLMultiArray initWithPixelBuffer:shape:]</code>).</p>
<p>For input features, using these objects in MLFeatureValue is enough to take advantage of the efficient data processing. When the output feature type matches the type above, CoreML automatically uses these objects in the output feature values as well.</p>
<p>For output features, you can even request the neural engine to write into your own buffer directly. See <code>-[MLPredictionOptions outputBackings]</code>.</p>
<p>You can create <code>MTLTexture</code> view into the pixel buffer with <code>CVMetalTextureCache</code>.</p>
<p>Amazing, thanks a lot for your help!</p>
<p>&lt;@U03J52T5J22&gt;</p>
<p>is there any chance you will add support for at least 4 channels no-copy buffers?</p>
<p>these features are really cool and long-awaited but almost all cv models produce or take as input rgb or n channels data</p>
<p>&gt;  is there any chance you will add support for at least 4 channels no-copy buffers?
One way is to stack each channel on height axis and use that big pixel buffer as a backing of MLMultiArray. So:</p>
<pre><code>let backingPixelBuffer = ... // size = (width, height * 4), format = kCVPixelFormatType_OneComponent16Half
let multiArray = MLMultiArray(pixelBuffer: backingPixelBuffer, shape: [4, height, width])
</code></pre>
<p>This won’t work if your image representation is so called “packed” format, where each channel is interleaved in the frame buffer. We appreciate your feedback assistant report with a use case if that’s what you are looking for.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03J52T5J22&gt; ugh, that's not gonna work for my rgb-rgb models</p>
<p>are <code>float16</code> <code>MLMultiArray</code> no-copy also? will there be a copy event if I specify user-allocated <code>MLMultuArray</code> with float16 data into <code>outputBackings</code>?</p>
<p>my goal is to share a memory between <code>MPSImage</code> and <code>MLModel</code> output so there is a seamless ANE-to-GPU transition</p>
<p>The neural engine is unable to write into <code>MLMultiArray</code> directly unless it was initialized with an IOSurface-backed pixel buffer. (<code>-initWithPixelBuffer:shape:</code>)</p>
<p>is direct writing to IOSurface-backed buffers compatible with flexible shape input/outputs?</p>
<p>Hello, Andrew:) I’ve guessed you'll be interested in this thread:)</p>
<p>&lt;@U03J52T5J22&gt; friendly tagging you so the question doesn't get lost in thread notifications :innocent:</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HY66772A&gt; these insights are crazy valuable, really appreciate the opportunity</p>
<p>&gt; is direct writing to IOSurface-backed buffers compatible with flexible shape input/outputs?
As the application needs to prepare the output buffer in <code>-outputBackings</code> property, it must know the shape of the output before invoking the inference. Some flexible shape models (e.g. enumerated input shapes) meet the criteria, but so called “dynamic shape”, where the output shape is dynamically determined by the network, won’t work.</p>
<p>yup, enumerated shapes is something I'm targeting for</p>
<p>so If I have both input and output with an enumaratedly flexible shape I can pass one of pre-allocated buffer pairs and still no copy will occur?</p>
<p>Sorry, I do not have a definitive answer. I would suggest to test it with the latest Instruments, which <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10027/|shows the buffer copy event in the analysis">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10027/|shows the buffer copy event in the analysis</a> and send feedback assistant request if the outcome is not desired.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03J52T5J22&gt; thanks for quick and excellent answers! it was crazy useful and insightful</p>
<p>You are welcome, Andrew and Viacheslav! Enjoy the rest of WWDC 2022!!</p>

<p>Hi &lt;@U03HVCXR1T8&gt;.  You are right about Arabic support; While Apple announced more language support for Live Text this year, Arabic was not one of them.  The complete list is here:</p>

<p>It's not possible to extend Live Text to add additional user languages at this time.</p>
<p>To build your own system would require solving multiple ML problems, including locating text in the image, decomposing it into graphemes (characters), and to be robust it should probably include some sort of spelling/grammar layer to reduce transcription errors.</p>
<p>Building a complete solution like this is beyond what CreateML is designed for today.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It applies for training and validation data, but only at training time, not when doing predictions.</p>
<p>Ah yes, I misunderstood “predictions” as “validation”. Thank you.
Applying augmentations during validation seems not ideal though? Don’t you typically want to test/validate on unadulterated input data?</p>
<p>In other words, the augmentations are not part of the task definition. They are applied directly to the data.</p>
<p>That's a good point!</p>
<p>In terms of the overall design, I think it might be better if the augmentation transform could be passed to the fitting or update method, so that you can have random augmentations that are different for each epoch, rather than baking a fixed set of augmentations into the training data.</p>
<p>I mean that the outputs of the augmentations would be different for each epoch.</p>
<p>Yes. Please share your feedback through Feedback Assistant.</p>

<p>It depends on the desired buffer layout of PCM data (interleaved or separate, int16 or float32, etc). A good starting point can be:

<p>&lt;@U03J52T5J22&gt; What would be the best way to have a MLMultiArray of shape [2, 44100] being 44100 equivalent to one second of audio? The main objective is to use the MLMultiArray on a CoreML prediction.</p>
<p>Where does the audio data come from? If you already have a buffer with the desired layout, you can use: <code>-[MLMultiArray initWithDataPointer:shape:dataType:strides:deallocator:error]</code> or <code>MLShapedArray(bytesNoCopy:shape:strides:deallocator:)</code>.</p>
<p>If you need to copy with some data type conversion (e.g. <code>short</code> to <code>float32</code>) <code>MLShapedArray(unsafeUninitializedShape:initializingWith:)</code> would work.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03J52T5J22&gt; it comes from an AAC audio file as we mentioned in the question.</p>
<p>I see. AAC audio is often decoded to a sequence of audio chunks which is not aligned to one second boundary. So, we would need to do some (tedious) buffer munching. I will look for and/or write up some sample code. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>yay!</p>
<p>looking forward to it!</p>
<p>Hi Eddie! Thank you for waiting. The following code loads an AAC file into <code>MLShapedArray</code> for every one second and write each back to a new AAC file.</p>
<p><code>MLShapedArray</code> is a Swift-y cousin of <code>MLMultiArray</code> and, if you are using Swift, it is preferred over <code>MLMultiArray</code>. CoreML accepts either type. <code>MLMultiArray(_ shapedArray:)</code> and <code>MLShapedArray(_ multiArray:)</code> can convert between them.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>Hi &lt;@U03JW43N2TV&gt; does your cloud instance understand CoreML format? I am assuming you are referring to compiled and encrypted CoreML models?</p>
<p>Yes, compiled and encrypted models. I am zipping them, download and then unzip on the device.</p>
<p>Hosting in S3. It is working locally but when ipa is generated, decryption isn't working. Using the same Team ID both locally and generating ipa. Is it supposed to work?</p>

<p>Sure, will do. Follow up question, does encryption key and/or encryption process involve any app specific info like bundle identifier? Or, as long as the same Team is used, is it supposed to work?</p>
<p>I am following <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/generating_a_model_encryption_key?language=objc|Generating a Model Encryption Key">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/generating_a_model_encryption_key?language=objc|Generating a Model Encryption Key</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/encrypting_a_model_in_your_app?language=objc|Encrypting a Model in Your App">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/encrypting_a_model_in_your_app?language=objc|Encrypting a Model in Your App</a>.</p>
<p>Note: I would take a look at how much space savings 'zipping' is actually making in this case: you may just be wasting computation: encryption in particular produces files that won't compress well.   </p>
<p>ya, agree. Compiled and encrypted model is a directory. So, zipping is done to download it as a single file rather than to save space.</p>
<p>&gt; Follow up question, does encryption key and/or encryption process involve any app specific info like bundle identifier? Or, as long as the same Team is used, is it supposed to work?
Decryption process does involve a bundle-id check but, it should be transparent to your app. If your app (signed with correct team cert) loads the encrypted model, decryption should work as expected.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HB4VBDGX&gt; If we have different bundle identifiers for different environments, is there a way to generate encryption key that works for all bundle identifiers? For eg: if debug/dev environ has identifier that ends with <code>.development</code> and other envs ends with a different string.</p>
<p>Bundle ID is only used to make sure app that fetched the key for the first time is using the fetched key before decryption.</p>
<p>If you are not mixing those, you should be fine</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HB4VBDGX&gt; In that case, since the bundle ids are different for different environments, looks like I need to generate separate keys and host multiple encrypted models. Does wild card entries in bundle identifier field work while generating key and compiling with encryption? for eg: <code>com.something.something.*</code> . (Only the last <code>*</code> is variable in my case.)</p>
<p>&gt; Does wild card entries in bundle identifier field work while generating key and compiling with encryption? for eg: <code>com.something.something.*</code> . (Only the last <code>*</code> is variable in my case.)
It is not checked at the time of generating the key (in Xcode). It is checked at the time of fetching the key (at model load time before decryption).</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HB4VBDGX&gt; Is it checked at the time of fetching against the bundle id from the encryption key? If so, is it a char to char comparison? Or, having something like <code>com.something.something.*</code> when I generate the key, and <code>com.something.something.development</code>  and <code>com.something.something.Enterprise</code> with the actual app builds work?</p>
<p>&gt; Is it checked at the time of fetching against the bundle id from the encryption key?
Bundle id is looked up from your app on the device (so, in this case  <code>com.something.something.Enterprise</code>) and persisted for cross checking on future model loads. <code>com.something.something.development</code> is not stored anywhere. So, the example you provided <em>should</em> work. If you have the feedback assistant ID, I can take a closer look at the error and get back to with what might be going on.</p>
<p>Yes, bundle id is looked from the app on the device and is compared against what? I am assuming it is compared against the ID from the encryption key?</p>
<p>I tried submitting in the feedback assistant with sysdiagnose logs but it is failing. It may be coz the logs are above 400MB. In the console, I see <code>MLModelAsset: load failed with error Error Domain=com.apple.CoreML Code=8 UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=&amp;lt;private&amp;gt;}</code> from the build. I am trying to generate another build with an added <code>NSLog</code> so that I see more details in the console. I will follow up once it is ready. In the meanwhile, before I lose you, I wanted to make sure if I can use wild chars in the bundle id at the time of key generation so that it matches with dev and prod builds' bundle ids.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HB4VBDGX&gt;</p>
<p>Bundle id is looked up from your app when the key is fetched and persisted. On subsequent model loads, bundle id from your app is looked up to validate against the first bundle id that was persisted at the time of key fetch.
&gt; I am assuming it is compared against the ID from the encryption key?
No, bundle id is not associated with your encryption key.</p>
<p>&gt; I wanted to make sure if I can use wild chars in the bundle id at the time of key generation so that it matches with dev and prod builds' bundle ids.
This should not matter - CoreML only uses bundle ID from your app and if app store allows, it can have wild chars.</p>
<p>&gt; I will follow up once it is ready.
Sure</p>
<p>Ah got it. Bundle id only matter for subsequent loads then. My issue is with first load itself.</p>
<p>Exactly. If I see the entire error message, I might know what is differently with your case.</p>
<p>I see, <code>Fetching decryption key from server failed: noEntryFound("No records found"). Make sure the encryption key was generated with correct team ID.</code> . I believe our remote builds use the same Team ID as the one I used locally to generate the key. I am waiting for a confirmation on this. While I wait for it, I wanted to see if there could be any other reason for failure because I see different errors before and after this error.</p>
<p>Eg:</p>
<pre><code>Client &quot;com.apple.CoreMLModelSecurityService&quot; tried to access environment &quot;Production&quot;, even though the entitlements specified &quot;Sandbox&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like the Team IDs are different. Thanks a lot for you patience going through my issue.</p>
<p>No worries &lt;@U03JW43N2TV&gt;! I am glad we got to the bottom of this!</p>
<p>Which app is this, if you don't mind sharing</p>
<p>I personally don't mind but I may not be allowed to share unfortunately. I wanted to do a DM but looks like it is disabled. Sorry. :neutral_face:</p>
<p>No worries. Thanks!</p>
<p>&lt;@U03HB4VBDGX&gt; We use different team IDs for distribution and enterprise program. Do you have any suggestions on how to make the encryption work for our use case?</p>
<p>The only way I can think of is to encrypt the model with two different encryption keys (with different team IDs) and include both encrypted models in the app / make it available for download. App would pick the right model based on the variant.</p>

One of the ways I'm working on doing this is by doing text classification. Given 5 categories of diary entry (eg family, health, spiritual, work, recreational), would it be preferred to use a single model that labels text with one of the 5? Or should I follow the SentimentClassifier example and use 5 separate models that each classify a string in 3 ways (notFamily, neutralFamily, isFamily)? If the latter, is this a use case for components?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually what I would tend to try first would be a single classifier model that labels text with one of your classes. That should be efficient and robust, and scale reasonably well with the number of classes. If you train multiple models, you would need to run each of them on each article you want to classify. However, the questions being asked are subtly different in the two different cases. With a single model, you are asking which category or categories best match a given document. When you use separate models, you are asking whether a given document relates to a given category or not. The question you want to ask informs everything from your annotation to the type of model you use to the way you present your results. Ultimately you will have to decide what analysis is best suited to your particular application.</p>
<p>Thanks for your great response. This definitely gives me a good direction</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The most robust approach to this sort of categorization would be to pick a set of categories in advance, collect training data, and train a classifier to classify sentences according to these categories. If you need to handle words outside the originally chosen set of categories, you could then use word embeddings to find an existing category similar to the entered word. If you aren't able to train a model, things get a bit trickier. You can use tools such as part-of-speech tagging to identify relevant words in a sentence, e.g. nouns in the example you give, and determine how similar those are to the word you are trying to match. You would then need to figure out some way to take scores for individual words and form a score for an entire sentence. Overall I think you would get better results by training a classifier, although it would require more work in advance for training.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes this will work as long as the output backing buffer is the correct size corresponding to the size of the input. One note is that being able to avoid data copies during inference for models with flexible shapes will vary depending on circumstances. You can use the Core ML Instrument and look in the Data lane to see if data copies are occurring.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Natural Language has a number of tools that can be useful in keyword extraction: tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, gazetteers that could be used to identify stop words, and so on. We don't provide an implementation of a specific keyword or keyphrase extraction algorithm, but there are algorithms that are sometimes used that take into account features such as frequency, co-occurrence statistics, TF-IDF, etc. that can be calculated from text that has been tokenized and processed using some of these tools. Doing this fully unsupervised is a difficult task, though. You might be able to do better if you have some advance knowledge of the vocabulary that is relevant to the sort of text you will be working with.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><code>MLComputeUnits.all</code> is the default option and we recommend using that in most of the cases. CoreML tries to optimize for latency while utilizing all the available compute units. <code>MLComputeUnits.cpuAndNeuralEngine</code> is helpful when your app is using GPU for pre or post processing and would like CoreML to not dispatch the model on GPU. Other than that <code>MLComputeUnits.cpuAndNeuralEngine</code> behaves very similar to <code>MLComputeUnits.all</code>. If you have a model that is running much slower on certain devices, we recommend filing some feedback at <a href="http://feedbackassistant.apple.com">http://feedbackassistant.apple.com</a> with the model and specific device(s) included.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>For the DataScannerViewController? Sorry, right now just the 1 option for shipment tracking numbers and it's whatever carrier we're able to detect</p>
<p>Thanks for the answer. It could be awesome if there was a protocol that we can conform to so that we could extend the detected source.</p>
<p>How would you imagine that protocol working?</p>
<p>I assume that you're checking some kind of Regex for the tracking numbers. I also believe that maybe they have other validations as well like international tracking numbers have some check code. I wish there could be a protocol or a delegate method so that we could define our new methods or the extend the existing ones. I know I just can just scan for text but it would be better to extend the existing ones.  </p>
<p>Gotcha, I think I understand. Maybe something that gives you some text and you can tell us the range you’re interested in.</p>
<p>Exactly. Currently live text can find the FedEx tracking number because it's 12 digits. It knows that 12 digits is a tracking number and it draws a box around it. So maybe my courier Acme Corp has a tracking number of ACME-<tel:12526737|12526737>. It can't detect this as a tracking number because live text supports limited number of couriers. Only way to get this with camera is, just using a default source and selecting it manually. I just wish we could extend the default ones or give visionkit a pattern to look for.</p>
<p>^ This may be useful for detecting car license plates aswell imo (different patterns depending on countries though)</p>

<p>It depends! The two key considerations are:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ah, good enhancement request. Currently we're not supporting currency.</p>
<p>you might be able to detect the presence of currency with UIDataDetectors, but you won't be able to highlight them.</p>
<p>another option is to use <code>capturePhoto()</code> to take as till then use the Live Text APIs</p>
<p>That'll highlight all the data detector elements, not just money.</p>
<p>Maybe some business logic on top of Vision text recognition to dial in on numbers only, specific (relative) text size or even position of the text in the rectangle of the currency?</p>
<p>Ah, I see. So I assume that I could grab all text, but wouldn’t necessarily be able to easily find the exact position of the numbers/currency in the view to provide an accurate highlight rectangle of just that portion.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Vision will not tell you which languages have been detected. The intent of this is to allow the client to give a "hint" to the algorithm. If you already know the language up-front, it's best to specify that language explicitly, which allows the framework to target that language for better accuracy. If you do not, it's better to set automaticallyDetectsLanguage to true, which essentially is communicating to the framework "I don't know which language" and the framework will do its best to decode any language.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/nllanguagerecognizer|NLLanguageRecognizer">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/nllanguagerecognizer|NLLanguageRecognizer</a> to detect the dominate language after the text has been extracted by vision.</p>
<p>Usually a sentence is sufficient to identify language. You can pass in as much as you like, but the algorithm limits the amount of text it will consider. Less than maybe 5-10 words is challenging.</p>
<p>If you have some prior information as to what the language might be, you can also pass hints and/or constraints to NLLanguageRecognizer.</p>

<p>RecognizedItem contains a lot of the same information. transcript, corners (RecognizedItem's are in view coordinates, however)... and RecognizedItem exposes the related Vision observation. RecognizedItem however learns over time so the longer we see a text group, the more accurate the transcript will be. The Vision observation that is exposed, it is really just based on the last frame processed.</p>

At the moment Ive had success with Photos/Vision framework to find faces in photos and isolate them, but we're currently then sending those faces to AWS Amazon Rekognition service to help compare the face to a set of others and associate them to an existing face, or create a new face model.  If I wanted to move this type of modelling onto the device itself (rather going through a network request to a 3rd party service), could you possibly guide me where to start? Im assuming I could do the same thing locally on device using Apple frameworks?</h4>

<p>We do not offer on-device face recognition solutions. Generally speaking you would to either find (or train, if you have the data and the know-how) a face recognition model, which could then be run on-device through CoreML once converted into that format. Often such models return some descriptor, which can be compared to other similar descriptors to provide a distance. How best to measure that distance is often tied in to how the face recognition model was trained.</p>
<p>ah ok. Thanks for the detail. :slightly_smiling_face: Seems like it would be a bit of work to bring it on device (as no one on our team currently has the "know how" to train models), but its good to know that that is the suggested direction to go in. :slightly_smiling_face: Or continue using a service like AWS's which have really made it quite simple (at the expense of network request).
But thank you for the response!</p>
<p>You may file a Feedback Assistant request if you'd like Apple to offer face recognition in the future.</p>
<p>Haha that would be a dream feature indeed. So I shall contribute a feedback request! :blush: thanks!</p>

<p>There is no hard and fast size that works for everything. The reason is that is limited by the ratio of the dog or human in respect to the image to be detected. So it depends on your use case if you for instance want to find a small dog in the background in a large panorama.</p>

<p>Hi &lt;@U03JE2RJ2DA&gt;. Yes, you can adapt a model on-device using any one of our ML frameworks, including Core ML, Create ML Components, MPSGraph, and BNNS. The approach you take depends on the data and problem you are working with. To detect hand poses, I recommend checking out the sample code project <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/detecting_hand_poses_with_vision|Detecting Hand Poses with Vision">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/detecting_hand_poses_with_vision|Detecting Hand Poses with Vision</a>. If you foresee training on a small dataset, then it might be worth looking into using the KNN algorithm available in CoreML, check out the sample code project <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/model_personalization/personalizing_a_model_with_on-device_updates|Personalizing a Model with On-Device Updates">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/model_personalization/personalizing_a_model_with_on-device_updates|Personalizing a Model with On-Device Updates</a> to learn more.

<p>I tried the sample code on 6th gen. iPad Mini doing 20 jumper jacks at VARYING paces. I found delays and missing counts. The first few jumper jacks were always not being counted. I’m guessing the hard coded stride 5 and length 90 used for sliding window transformer may be the culprit. To me there isn’t a correct set of numbers to use because I have no control on how fast or slow my users will do his or her jumper jacks. Please advise.  </p>
<p>Hello &lt;@U03J9GM2ESE&gt; , a few things you may further check:
• frame rate, the sample app should print out the frame rate as debug information in the Xcode console. Please check if it is roughly 30fps. If not, try to improve the environment lighting, charge the device, etc. and see if it improves.
• body pose, please check if a single person’s full body pose is in the middle of the screen, and while the person moves, check if the poses are accurate (e.g., no missing joints or joints jumping everywhere, no visible delays of pose tracking, etc.)
• ignored joints in <code>JointsSelector</code> . The initial setting here has 5 joints ignored (for demonstration of this transformer purpose). You may remove them if you are interested in the full body and all joints.
• <code>stride</code>  determines how often (in terms of frame count) the counter is refreshed, and it can be set to other numbers. The <code>length</code> 90 however should not be changed. This is fixed for the model.
• <code>Downsampler</code> transformer has a factor of 1, which works best for actions close to ~1s per repetition. It can tolerate the varying speed to some extend. If your targeted action is typically much slower, you may set the factor to 2, or other numbers, this may increase the counter delay too. Unfortunately, you have to manually set it in the sample app for now.<br />
• You are also free to change some of the other logics in the sample app, such as how <code>uiCount</code>  is rounded and reset, etc.  </p>
<p>Correct me if I’m wrong.
1. Virtual HIIT fitness coach is not a good app idea for today. Action classifier can’t classify actions fast and accurate enough on mobile devices today?
2. The model was trained using 30 fps and a prediction windows size of 90 frames under the assumption that each human body action lasts about 3 seconds?</p>
<p>Hi &lt;@U03J9GM2ESE&gt; , see my comments below:
1. Action classifier is a model template that needs to be trained. So it is good with fitness actions that it was trained with, such as jumping jacks, squats, and some HIIT actions. Depending on your specific needs, we may further talk about how fast the actions could be and how accurate etc. topics. Some resources are also here:
• How to train an action classifier with your custom action videos: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml/creating-an-action-classifier-model">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml/creating-an-action-classifier-model</a>
• WWDC20 session for action classifier: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10043/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10043/</a>
• iOS sample app for action classifier (can classify jumping jacks, etc.): <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml/detecting_human_actions_in_a_live_video_feed">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml/detecting_human_actions_in_a_live_video_feed</a></p>
<ol>
<li>For your 2nd bullet, this model is a separate model for counting actions (not action classifier back to WWDC20). It is class-agnostic, exposed via our API and does not need to be trained. It was trained with 30fps videos, and window size is 90 frames. But this is a completely different model, the window size 90 isn’t the same concept with action classifier’s window size. Within these 90 frames, multiple completed actions are OK (e.g., best with 2~4 action repetitions captured within the window). If you have videos or camera feed other than 30fps, you could choose to downsample, using <code>Downsampler</code>  transformer. If your targeted actions are 30fps, but quite slower, such as push-ups, you could choose to do downsampling too.</li>

Thank you! The MetalFX team has presented a very nice (classical) method for video upscaling. What is the potential of using MSP to achieve machine learning upscaling?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>MPSGraph supports most common neural-network machine learning layers and operations so you should be able to create an upscaling network from the basic components, but MPSGraph doesn't have prebuilt graphs or networks so you would need to investigate and research the network architecture yourself, train it (using MPSGraph or other training frameworks) and deploy on MPSGraph.
One benefit of using MPSGraph is that you can pretty easily incorporate other Metal kernels (for example MPS image processing kernels or your own kernels) and encode them to the same Metal CommandQueue (or MPSCommandBuffer) to achieve low-latency, often zero-copy execution between the pre/post-processing kernels and the MPSGraph segment(s).</p>

<p>MPSGraph should run just fine with iOS and iPadOS. There are no special pre-built functions that achieve techniques like PFL, but using for example the random-number generators provided by MPSGraph, one should be able to generate these operations from basic building-blocks. Then as long as you can aggregate the gradients or other weight-updates across the network (something outside the scope of MPSGraph) you should be able to do this. But again quite a bit of manual work is needed</p>
<p>Thank you again Teemu for the a quite detailed reply! Exactly, it requires some manual work indeed to make it work, and that's why I was wondering if there was some interfacing functionality enabling a more efficient merging between these two important techniques was developed. It's nice to know that the technology is readily available and fully operational for mobile devices as well! :slightly_smiling_face:</p>

Note that, depending on the details,  you may have to perform the pre-processing of the text input transformation to a tensor representation outside the pytorch model given to the coremltools convert API. The conversion operates on pytorch models with tensor in tensor out interface.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03J4CNMT6D&gt; thanks for sharing this!</p>

“perform the pre-processing of the text input transformation to a tensor representation outside the pytorch model”</p>
<p>Any reference you could share on how to do that?</p>

<p>Hi &lt;@U03HMDSQ9JB&gt; could you clarify this part?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Is it possible to dispatch a CoreML evaluation as part of a display or compute shader pipeline.</p>
<p>Are you looking to run CoreML evaluation from a compute shader pipeline?</p>
<p>I would like to be able to have a coreML model run an inference evaluation as soon as a compute or even display render pass finishes rather than need to wait for the cpu to be informed that it has finshed.  Best of all would be if it could run on the ANE so that the GPU is free to work on the next frame.</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p>If the output of GPU is in a IOSurface (in Float16 format), you can feed that to CoreML and let ANE work on it directly without any copies but, CPU does get triggered today for synchronizing these two computations. Would you be able to file a feature request on <a href="http://feedbackassistant.apple.com|feedbackassistant.apple.com">http://feedbackassistant.apple.com|feedbackassistant.apple.com</a> with a little more details about your use case and may be some sample code on how you want to accomplish this?

<p>yes I think using the code from the repo at the end of the article is the best way to get started, and definitely follow along the recommendations of the article as well. Sounds like you are already on the right track!</p>
<p>afact, ane_transformers just includes distilbert…  how the recommendations apply to that code is maybe a little opaque to me. Need to think about how I would apply this to a different model, haven’t had enough time to digest it this week.</p>
<p>The default conversion should be quite efficient as well for the neural engine (NE). With the new performance tab in Xcode 14, you will see whether the model is already neural engine resident or not.
There are details in the post <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/neural-engine-transformers">https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/neural-engine-transformers</a> on some of the changes specific to distill bert which may or may not be required for the transformer architecture in CLIP.
In any case if you find any inefficiencies after conversion, feel free to share with us via a feedback request. We are constantly adding new converter and NE compiler optimizations to automatically detect patterns and map them efficiently to NE, so such feedback is very valuable!</p>
<p>Thanks, Aseem. I got stuck on the Performance tab not working on my M1 mac (FB10107014), but I tested it out with an attached iPhone 12 now.</p>
<p>Will file an issue about this when I try to open Instruments</p>
<p>Ah, it’s just the wrong version of instruments, will try to find the file on disk. Really appreciate the inspectability coming this year!</p>
<p>very cool!</p>
<p>There are more details to be found in the following article as well, hope this helps: <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/on-device-scene-analysis">https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/on-device-scene-analysis</a></p>

How did he come to that conclusion and how can I look at my performance metrics to determine our frames per second as well?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 second there is 1000ms, so if your model runs at 22ms, you can run it 1000/22 = 45 times.</p>
<p>The number is just an upper bound estimate based on 1s / 22ms = ~45 prediction per seconds. Such estimates often help us to understand the amount of headroom we can use for other operations while meeting the real time requirement (30 fps, etc).</p>

<p>No, it is not supported. It is an interesting use case. A feedback assistant report will be much appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Matthew, one option is to implement your own custom estimator using a framework like MPSGraph. To simplify the task (and data required), you may want to explore training the classifier on the features produced by a feature extractor, such as &lt;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createmlcomponents/imagefeatureprint
|ImageFeaturePrint&gt;.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://coremltools.readme.io/docs/composite-operators|composite ops doc">https://coremltools.readme.io/docs/composite-operators|composite ops doc</a> that can be used to build ops composed of existing CoreML (MIL) ops</p>
<p>Ah, I meant when using PyTorch on its own rather than when converting to CoreML. Eg with a metal compute kernel.</p>
<p>&lt;@U03JZNY81L0&gt;, I don't think so you can use it as it is rather than converting to CoreML.</p>
<p>IF anyone knows, I'm interested to learn about it. Specially for tensorflow.</p>
<p>I can't use MobileNetV3 due to Swish operation doesn't support with CoreML</p>
<p>&lt;@U03JLPLT8HK&gt; You can definitely <a href="https://coremltools.readme.io/docs/custom-operators|implement a custom operator">https://coremltools.readme.io/docs/custom-operators|implement a custom operator</a> in the CoreML context, though the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/method/hard-swish|hard-swish operation">https://paperswithcode.com/method/hard-swish|hard-swish operation</a> might be able to be expressed as a combination of other ops in CoreML as well</p>
<p>&lt;@U03JLPLT8HK&gt; from that link it looks like you could use <a href="https://apple.github.io/coremltools/source/coremltools.converters.mil.mil.ops.defs.html#coremltools.converters.mil.mil.ops.defs.activation.relu6|RELU6">https://apple.github.io/coremltools/source/coremltools.converters.mil.mil.ops.defs.html#coremltools.converters.mil.mil.ops.defs.activation.relu6|RELU6</a> + <a href="https://apple.github.io/coremltools/source/coremltools.converters.mil.mil.ops.defs.html#coremltools.converters.mil.mil.ops.defs.elementwise_binary.mul|multiply">https://apple.github.io/coremltools/source/coremltools.converters.mil.mil.ops.defs.html#coremltools.converters.mil.mil.ops.defs.elementwise_binary.mul|multiply</a>, etc to replace the hard-swish efficiently</p>
<p>Hi &lt;@U03JZNY81L0&gt;, to learn more about GPU acceleration for Pytorch and Tensorflow, please refer to "Accelerate machine learning with Metal":
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10063/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10063/</a></p>
<p>Specifically, Pytorch is open sourced, so you can leverage this to implement custom operations in Metal. Custom ops are also supported for TensorFlow as outlined in the session.</p>

<p>Are you interested in how the app was built or the model itself?</p>
<p>You can learn about how Create ML can help you build style transfer models with an example integration in this session: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10642/|Build Image and Video Style Transfer models in Create ML">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10642/|Build Image and Video Style Transfer models in Create ML</a></p>
<p>There are also a wide variety of style transfer models online that can be converted to Core ML format with coremltools</p>
<p>The model takes in an image and outputs an image</p>
<p>Both the app and the model was built</p>
<p>…and how the model was built</p>
<p>Do the resources above help?</p>
<p>I believe the app is  streaming data from an AVCaptureSession and running each frame through the Core ML model and outputting the result properly scaled back to the original image size</p>
