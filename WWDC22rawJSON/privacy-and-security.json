People have already used their devices to replace older ways of doings things, and now it’s happening with passwords. The wide industry support means that there’s a really great chance that this succeeds.\n\nPeople hate passwords. Constantly forget them. Feel guilt about not using them properly. Passwords are honestly pretty unpleasant.\n\nThis is a chicken and egg problem. Users have a right to be skeptical about this — we, collectively as an industry, haven’t shown them that passkeys are awesome _*yet*._ Your organization can be on the earlier side of making this industry-wide transition happen, or on the later side.\n\nAs you weigh this timing, make sure y’all are considering the user experience and security benefits of establishing unphishable accounts.",

We're also joined here by our team who are ready to answer your questions!\n\nI know you all are excited to start the video, and we are as well. I will hit the play button at 11:05 am PDT. If you have already watched the video, no spoilers, please :).\n\nDuring this time you get to interact with the presenters and our team. Looking at the number of folks joined here, we are going to receive a lot of questions. Our team and I are going to do our best to keep things organized. As the video progresses, I'll be creating threads associated with each section of the talk, where everyone can chat and ask questions.\n\nI got my popcorn (caramel popcorn, my favourite!), grab yours, and get ready to hit the play button in 5 minutes!",

Our team and I are excited to watch the Enhance your Sign in with Apple Experience with all of you in this hour.\n\nI am very excited to introduce our speakers Ram Shandliya and Patrick Hickey. We're also joined here by our team who are ready to answer your questions!\n\nI know you all are excited to start the video, and we are as well. I will hit the play button at 11:05 am PDT. If you have already watched the video, no spoilers, please :).\n\nDuring this time you get to interact with the presenters and our team. Looking at the number of folks joined here, we are going to receive a lot of questions. Our team and I are going to do our best to keep things organized. As the video progresses, I'll be creating threads associated with each section of the talk, where everyone can chat and ask questions.\n\nI got my popcorn (caramel popcorn, my favourite!), grab yours, and get ready to hit the play button in 5 minutes!"
