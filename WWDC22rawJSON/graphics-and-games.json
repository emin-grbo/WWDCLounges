Essentially, I’m looking to see if there’s some intermediary step I can take that would allow me to migrate from the patterns I have now, even if the translation would be slow, just to build out some observations to make better hypotheses from.\n\nThat would be something like, “a function that takes a parent node and generates a mesh” or something along that."

My name is Joshua from the Game Center team, I’ll be your guide through this digital lounge. I’m excited to introduce you to our speaker Knott. As an engineer on the Game Center team Knott is excited to share with you whats coming to Game Center.\n\nWe invite everyone to watch the *\u003chttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10064/|Reach new players with Game Center dashboard\u003e* together at 11:05 PDT. We’re joined here by almost the entire Game Center team, ready to answer your questions!! There’s a lot of us here, so we’re going to do our best to keep things organized.\n\nAs we watch the video together I’ll be creating threads (:thread:) for each section of the presentation please feel free to chat and react with the Game Center team.\n\nQueue up that video and get ready to hit play at *11:05 PDT.*\nVideo Link: *\u003chttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10064/\u003e*\n\nAfter the video we’ll have some time for an additional targeted Q\u0026amp;A. We’ll enable a Slack workflow that allows you to submit any questions you have, we’ll do our best to answer as many as we can. (To ask a question, Click the Plus button (:heavy_plus_sign:) in the lower left of the chat then find the “Ask a Question” :zap:.)",

Here's a basic one, with some context: I'm a mobile developer working for about a decade in the space, and I have very little experience with high-fidelity graphics and their libraries. I am highly interested in learning C++, especially to interact with the new metal-cpp tools. My question is, would the metal-cpp examples shared here in this lounge be a good starting point into learning enough C++ to be productive with Metal? Or, is there a better starting point that may be a more gradual or helpful introduction to the tools? I don't mind hitting the ground running so to speak, just curious to see what paths are most suggested for this! Thank you!",

Mesh shader pipeline is a good fit for techniques that can be expressed as one or more mesh shader threadgroups (meaning, each such threadgroup maps 1:1 to a fixed size output mesh you declare in the shader), and you have the object shader stage to dynamically decide how many of those output meshes you will need.\n\nThere is no particular input formats or intermediate data formats that the pipeline is tied to, so if your input is meshes in device memory, that could work."

USD is also widely supported on all sorts of Apple frameworks so you can save a lot of dev time using that as a spec for your file format. Model I/O, RealityKit etc. In my experience, the biggest pain point for USD lies in the tools the artists want to use. A lot of Blender enthusiasts for example are still lacking a fully featured USD export with skinned animation. The best you can do without a custom exporter is send the file to glTF and then use RealityConverter to get it to USD. But that isn't ideal for all use cases. ",

              "text": "In mathematical analysis and computer science, functions which are Z-order, Lebesgue curve, Morton space filling curve, Morton order or Morton code map multidimensional data to one dimension while preserving locality of the data points. It is named in France after Henri Lebesgue, who studied it in 1904, and named in US after Guy Macdonald Morton, who first applied the order to file sequencing in 1966. The z-value of a point in multidimensions is simply calculated by interleaving the binary representations of its coordinate values. Once the data are sorted into this ordering, any one-dimensional data structure can be used such as binary search trees, B-trees, skip lists or (with low significant bits truncated) hash tables. The resulting ordering can equivalently be described as the order one would get from a depth-first traversal of a quadtree or octree.",
